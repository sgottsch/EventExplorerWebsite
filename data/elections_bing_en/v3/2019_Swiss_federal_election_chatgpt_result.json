The Swiss People's Party (UDC/SVP), the Swiss Socialists Party (PS/SP), and the Liberal Radical Party won the most seats in the National Council (11). There was a record number of women running for parliament (6). The election also saw the breakthrough of the Greens (1, 11). The results can be explored in detail on the election maps (18). However, despite female voters outnumbering male voters by 10%, women remain a minority in cantonal and federal politics (19). The winners of the Freethinker Prize 2019, author Salman Rushdie and director Barbara Miller, were honored for their advocacy for humanist values and the freedom of art and expression (17)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/October/7", "Text": "Information about the upcoming 2019 Swiss federal election is shared on social media.", "Articles": ["20"]}, {"Date": "2019/October/17", "Text": "A Swiss news outlet shares an article about a tourist's experience in Zermatt and mentions the upcoming election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2019/October/18", "Text": "An article discusses the use of social media by Swiss political parties in the lead-up to the election.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2019/October/20", "Text": "The 2019 Swiss federal election takes place, with results being shared on various news outlets.", "Articles": ["1", "4", "9", "11"]}, {"Date": "2019/October/21", "Text": "Google Maps Mania shares a map showing the results of the 2019 Swiss federal election.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2019/October/25", "Text": "The Swiss Soroptimist hosts a film screening to raise funds for women's projects, including those related to the election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2019/November/7", "Text": "The recipients of the Swiss Freethinker Award, including author Salman Rushdie, are announced.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2019/November/24", "Text": "A map from the 1995 Swiss federal election is shared on Wikimedia Commons.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2019/December/11", "Text": "The Swiss Federal Council is elected, with the council being in place until the next election in 2023.", "Articles": ["13"]}]}}}
