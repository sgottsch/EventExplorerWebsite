The runoff was between Igor Dodon (pro-Russian socialist PSRM) and Maia Sandu (pro-EU liberal PAS) (1). Dodon was expected to win (1). The election sparked discussion on whether Moldova should continue its pro-Western stance or pivot back to Russia (6,7,9). In July 2016, the Moldovan Parliament adopted a law to protect victims of violence, including the use of a 10-day emergency restraining order (4). U.S. President Barack Obama warned Russia about interfering in the election (8). Dodon, a former president, was defeated by Sandu in the 2020 election (5). In October 2016, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited London for discussions on Syria and potentially Russia's influence in the upcoming Moldovan election (5).
