The candidates included Hillary Clinton, who was praised by President Barack Obama as the most qualified candidate in history (3), and Donald Trump, who invited Russia to meddle in the election (8). The election was also closely monitored by political experts, with some predicting that it would be the hardest election to predict yet (10). The Estonian Electoral College was unable to choose a president in the first round of voting (1), and concerns were raised about the verifiability of the Estonian internet voting scheme (2).
