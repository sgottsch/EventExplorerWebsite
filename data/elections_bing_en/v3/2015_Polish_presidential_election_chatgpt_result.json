The election was held on May 24, 2015 (1,2,4,5,6) and resulted in Duda's win (1,2,4,5,6,8). The election was hotly contested and there were many public meetings and campaign events leading up to the second round on May 24 (2,4,5,6). The Law and Justice party's victory in the election was seen as a shift to the right (1) and was celebrated by their supporters (2,4,5,6). The election was held in the aftermath of a new law on access to public information being passed (8) and was seen as a significant election for the country (7). The results of the first round of the election were released on May 11, 2015 (3)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2015/May/10", "Text": "The first round of the Polish presidential election takes place, with the Law and Justice party candidate, Andrzej Duda, receiving the second highest number of votes.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/20", "Text": "Andrzej Duda holds his final public meeting before the second round of the presidential election.", "Articles": ["2", "4", "5", "6"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/24", "Text": "The second round of the presidential election takes place and Andrzej Duda is elected as the new president of Poland, defeating incumbent Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/25", "Text": "The results of the presidential election signify a deeper political shift to the right in Poland.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/27", "Text": "Andrzej Duda's victory in the presidential election is deemed a surprising upset.", "Articles": ["10"]}]}, "President Of Poland": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Polish president concedes defeat in presidential election", "Sopot, Polen. 7.
