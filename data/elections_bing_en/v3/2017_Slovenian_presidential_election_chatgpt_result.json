Other candidates included MEP Romana Tomc (5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 19) and Ljudmila Novak (5). The election was marked by controversies, including debates over the role of the president and the use of social media (8, 10, 15, 18). The election was annulled in September by the Supreme Court, but Pahor won the re-run in October (11, 12).
