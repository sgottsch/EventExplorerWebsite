The current prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has been in power since 2010 and his party, Fidesz, has held a majority in the Hungarian National Assembly since then (2). The election is being observed by the Agora Election Observation Project (3). The opposition is concerned about Orb\u00e1n's policies and the potential impact on the EU (7). There is also speculation that Orb\u00e1n has invited former US President Donald Trump to visit Hungary in support of his re-election campaign (5). However, the opposition, led by prime minister candidate Peter M\u00e1rki-Zay, is focusing on the future of Hungary in the EU and NATO (6). If the opposition were to win, they have stated that they would not continue with the current plans to expand the Paks nuclear power plant (8). There are also concerns about the use of royalty-free stock photos by Fidesz (9). Ultimately, the outcome of the election will have a significant impact on both Hungary and the rest of Europe (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/April/3", "Text": "Hungary holds its parliamentary elections, with Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party expected to win another term in power.", "Articles": ["1", "3", "10"]}, {"Date": "2022/April/10", "Text": "A video is released showing all Hungarian parliamentary elections from 1832 to 2022.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2022/February/14", "Text": "The Agora Election Observation Project calls for volunteers and interpreters for the upcoming Hungarian parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["3", "6"]}, {"Date": "2022/February/15", "Text": "Fidesz continues to collect signatures to run in the parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["4", "8"]}, {"Date": "2022/February/23", "Text": "LMP co-leader M\u00e1t\u00e9 Kan\u00e1sz-Nagy states that if the united opposition wins the parliamentary elections, the expansion of the Paks nuclear power plant will not be implemented.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2022/March/25", "Text": "The Hungarian Conservative states that the Hungarian people's decision in the upcoming parliamentary elections is vital for their economic and social stability, as well as for the rest of Europe.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2022/March/30", "Text": "The Guardian reports that Viktor Orb\u00e1n has invited former US President Donald Trump to Hungary to support his re-election campaign.", "Articles": ["5", "9"]}, {"Date": "2022/April/10", "Text": "It is announced that Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party have won the Hungarian parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["2", "7"]}]}, "Fidesz": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Possible Scenarios for The Hungarian Parliamentary Elections", "Hungary: Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Government and European reaction", "Parliament elects Hungary's first ever woman president", "This is how Putin congratulates Orb\u00e1n on election victory", "Orban heads for election win in Hungary - The Washington Post", "Hungary's pro-Putin PM Orban claims victory in national vote", "Orban scores crushing victory as Ukraine war solidifies support - TODAY", "Map of the 2021 Moroccan Parliamentary Elections : r/MapPorn", "In Hungary, Viktor Orban Remakes an Election to His Liking", "Niccolo Luppino de Rivera Soldo on Twitter: \"Hungarian Parliamentary ...", "Viktor Orban Is Set for a Fourth Term as Hungary's Prime ... - Yahoo", "Hungarian parliamentary election, April 2022 - European Sources", "Orb\u00e1n: \"If we want peace, we can't vote for the left\" _ Daily News Hungary", "Hungarians will vote in a... - FRANCE 24 English - Facebook", "A Tale Of Two Diasporas: The Battle For Hungarian Voters Abroad", "Possible Scenarios for The Hungarian Parliamentary Elections", "2022 Elections: Ukrainian War Seems to Have Raised Fidesz\u2019s Popularity", "Hungarian Election Fell Short of International Standards, OSCE Says", "It\u2019s not just Putin.

The election was held on April 3, 2022 (2,4,6,8,10,11,13,14,16,17,20). The ruling Fidesz-KDNP alliance, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, won a fourth consecutive term in office with a two-thirds majority (2,4,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,17,18,20). Concerns have been raised about human rights and democratic developments in Hungary under Orban's leadership (2,19). The election was seen as a test for Orban's ambition of creating an \"illiberal\" state (6,8,10,12,16). The results were influenced by the ongoing Ukrainian war (2,20). The election also saw Hungary's first ever woman president, Katalin Novak, elected (3).
