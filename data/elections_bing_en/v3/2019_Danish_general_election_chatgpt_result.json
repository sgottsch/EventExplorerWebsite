The election saw the rise of the Social Democratic Party (8), led by Mette Frederiksen, who became the youngest ever Prime Minister of Denmark (8). The Red-Green Alliance, a left-wing political party, saw a decline in votes (4). This was part of a larger trend of power blocs losing ground in the European Parliament elections (2). The Red-Green Alliance's decline was in line with the general trend of left-wing parties performing poorly in the Indian general election (6). However, the European Parliament elections saw a higher turnout than in previous years (9). In India, only 723 of the 8,000 candidates were female (6), highlighting the lack of representation for women in politics. The election also saw a rejection of the BJP and their \"caste alliance\" in Tamil Nadu (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/June/5", "Text": "The Social Democratic Party wins the Danish general election and forms a government with the support of the Red-Green Alliance.", "Articles": ["1", "4", "5", "8"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/26", "Text": "The European Parliament elections result in a loss of power for traditional centrist parties and a gain for liberal, green, and nationalist parties.", "Articles": ["2", "3", "9"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/23", "Text": "The Tamil Nadu state election sees a rejection of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's 'caste alliance' and a victory for the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.", "Articles": ["10"]}]}, "Conservative People'S Party (Denmark)": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Dansk KFUK - Facebook", "Why did a party with more votes get fewer seats in the 2019 European ...", "Elections 2019: Conservatives retain control of West Lindsey District ...", "Conservatives slump to lowest national vote share ever in European election", "In Australia, Conservatives Win a Shock Victory.
