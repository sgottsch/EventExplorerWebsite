Despite attempts to end political deadlock and form a government, the election only deepened uncertainty about the future of the European Union's fifth-largest economy (3,7). The far-right Vox party made significant gains in the election, becoming the third force in parliament (6). The issue of Catalonia played a significant role in the election, with the possibility of suspending the region's political autonomy being discussed (8,10). This election also marked the first time the far-left Catalan pro-independence group, CUP, ran in a Spanish general election (2).
