The election took place on March 4, 2018 (3,10,14). Salvini has been challenging former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on the main points of their joint election manifesto (13). The party's new symbol has been seen as an attempt to appeal to former enemies (11). Salvini has also warned the European Union not to interfere in Italian internal affairs (8). The election resulted in a political deadlock, with no clear majority (12,17). Luigi Di Maio, leader of the populist Five Star Movement, has made attempts to form a coalition with the centre-left Democratic Party (19,20)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/March/4", "Text": "The Italian general election begins with the opening of polling stations.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/5", "Text": "Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigns as leader of the Democratic Party following their defeat in the election.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/5", "Text": "Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement makes a fresh attempt to form a coalition with the Democratic Party.", "Articles": ["20"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/7", "Text": "Matteo Salvini warns Brussels to stay out of Italian internal affairs regarding state pension reforms.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/12", "Text": "Matteo Salvini challenges former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on the main points of their joint election manifesto.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/27", "Text": "The new symbol of the Lega Nord party is unveiled, reflecting a shift in their approach towards the southern regions.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2018/April/4", "Text": "Luigi Di Maio announces his willingness to form a post-election coalition with the centre-left Democratic Party.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2018/April/27", "Text": "Matteo Salvini vows to not listen to Brussels' objections to his state pension reforms.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/2", "Text": "The 2018 Italian general election is analysed and discussed by political experts.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/8", "Text": "Matteo Salvini explains the role of George Soros in the Italian election.", "Articles": ["10"]}]}}}
