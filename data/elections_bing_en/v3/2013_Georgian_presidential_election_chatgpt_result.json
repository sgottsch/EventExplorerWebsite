The opposition attempted to annul President John Mahama's narrow victory in the disputed election (3). The impact of automation on elections was studied through the case of the May 2010 Philippine presidential election (5). In Tajikistan, members of the Core Team were deployed to support the presidential election in November 2013 (6). A former defense minister in Georgia was convicted and sent to prison (7). The role of social media in political communication was examined through Barack Obama's Facebook campaign in the 2012 presidential election (8). 686 applicants filed to run in Iran's 2013 presidential election, with eight approved to run and Hassan Rouhani ultimately winning (9). The biggest political story of 2013 was the decision of NSA contractor Edward Snowden to leak classified information and flee to Hong Kong (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2013/September/18", "Text": "More than 50 people are nominated for the Georgian presidential election, including David Bakradze from the United National Movement party.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2013/September/26", "Text": "The Georgian presidential election takes place, with Margvelashvili, Burjanadze, and Bakradze as frontrunners.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2013/October/28", "Text": "A former Georgian defense minister is convicted and sent to prison.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2013/November/10", "Text": "The role of social media in contemporary political communication is examined, with a focus on Barack Obama's Facebook campaign in the 2012 presidential election.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2013/December/11", "Text": "Edward Snowden's leak of classified information about the NSA begins to make headlines.", "Articles": ["10"]}]}, "Georgia": {"upper_aspect": "where", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Bitter feud dominates Georgia election - BBC News", "Rajasthan election results 2013: As it happened - Zee News", "Georgia's Presidential Election - Voice of America", "Rajasthan records highest voter turnout - India Today", "Smile Shop - Give your smile (Georgia) - LIVE - Junior 2013", "Election Results in Nepal Signal a Political Right Turn", "Georgia: another messiah - The Korea Times", "Georgia | World | The Guardian", "Your European Electoral Democracy Story Of The Day ... - Forbes", "Mitt Romney Wins 2013 Presidential Election! | Vanity Fair", "After 10 years Saakashvili of Georgia is out! - HyeForum", "Greece: Presidential Decree No. 141 (abolished) | Refworld", "President Says a Coup Failed in South Sudan (Published 2013)", "Michelle Bachelet wins presidential election in Chile | CNN", "Carter: Georgians think ACA 'a mess' - POLITICO", "IFES Election Guide | Elections: Swiss Referendum 2013 Sep 22", "In Indonesia, a Governor at Home on the Streets (Published 2013)", "Presidential Medal of Freedom 2013 Awards Ceremony - YouTube", "The Zimbabwe 2013 Election Rigging Report: Part 1", "Telo Christovo (Georgian); Fall, 2013 - YouTube"], "1": {"Title": "Bitter feud dominates Georgia election - BBC News", "Snippet": "The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie in Georgia says bitter rivalry between the president and prime minister is dominating this weekend's presidential election.", "URL": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24672090.amp", "Date": "2013-10-25"}, "2": {"Title": "Rajasthan election results 2013: As it happened - Zee News", "Snippet": "The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is headed for a landslide victory in Rajasthan, with the ruling Congress party conceding defeat.", "URL": "https://zeenews.india.com/assembly-elections-2013/rajasthan-polls/rajasthan-election-results-2013-as-it-happened_895191.html", "Date": "2013-12-08"}, "3": {"Title": "Georgia's Presidential Election - Voice of America", "Snippet": "This image contains sensitive content which some people may find offensive or disturbing.
