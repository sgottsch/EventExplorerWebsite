He took the oath of office on June 3, 2023, and began his third term as president (2,3). The election was considered a significant test of his political career (1). Erdogan's party declared victory in the parliamentary election, securing his outsize role in global affairs (11,12). The election was marred by disinformation (6) and was followed by a series of earthquakes (6). The election also received attention from other countries, with Azerbaijan's leader congratulating Erdogan (5) and Bosniak politicians campaigning for him (18). The election results were initially too close to call, leading to a runoff on May 28, 2023 (4,9,10,14,19). Erdogan ultimately won the runoff and extended his two-decade rule until 2028 (1,7,12,15,17)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2023/05/14", "Text": "Votes are being counted in Turkey's presidential and parliamentary elections, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan facing unprecedented challenges that could end his two-decade rule.", "Articles": ["4", "9", "19", "20"]}, {"Date": "2023/05/15", "Text": "Turkey braces for momentous first runoff after election drama.", "Articles": ["4", "5", "10", "14"]}, {"Date": "2023/05/27", "Text": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attends a rally, ahead of the May 28, 2023, presidential runoff vote, in Istanbul.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2023/05/28", "Text": "Turkey's President Erdogan wins runoff election, set to remain in power until 2028.", "Articles": ["11", "13", "15", "17"]}, {"Date": "2023/06/03", "Text": "Recep Tayyip Erdogan takes the oath of office at parliament in Ankara, Turkey.", "Articles": ["2", "3"]}]}}}
