The election was monitored by international observers, who reported that over 4 million people cast their ballots despite violence and logistical issues (9). This election also marks the first criminal case brought by the US Justice Department for alleged Russian interference in the 2018 midterm elections (7)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/December/10", "Text": "Catholicos Aram I of the Great House of Cilicia sends a letter to the Armenian President welcoming the snap parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2018/October/16", "Text": "The Armenian Weekly discusses the concept of 'revolutionary elections' in the context of the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2018/November/6", "Text": "The New Yorker offers three different ways to look at the results of the 2018 midterms, including the Armenian parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["3", "5", "10"]}, {"Date": "2018/October/14", "Text": "A Facebook page dedicated to Armenian furniture is created.", "Articles": ["2"]}]}, "Event": {}, "Christian-Democratic Rebirth Party": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Armenia votes to elect new parliament", "Poland\u2019s ruling party wins local polls, but opposition ... - POLITICO", "Jair Bolsonaro: Far-right candidate wins Brazil presidential election - CNN", "Telangana Assembly Elections 2018: Full polling schedule and ...", "Live coverage on Election Night | CNN Politics", "Farewell Speech As Prepared Ambassador Richard M.
