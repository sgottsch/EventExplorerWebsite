An interview with presidential candidate Mirsad Hadzikazdic discussed preparations for the election (5). The internationally appointed High Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina imposed amendments to the Constitution and Election Law after polls closed (6). The creation of the Republika Srpska and the tripartite presidency has caused problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina (7,8). Kenya's 2022 general election serves as a point of comparison (9).
