The election was called after a series of scandals and saw the rise of a liberal reform party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) (2,4). The election was significant as it was the first time since the 1950s that a party to the right of the Union entered the parliament (2). In addition, the election also saw the decline of traditional parties, such as the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) (2). The election also drew comparisons to other elections, such as the Kenyan presidential election (6) and the Australian high court ruling on politicians' citizenship (8). The election was also analyzed in terms of public attitudes towards elections and voting (9)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/September/8", "Text": "Norway prepares for a tight parliamentary election, with the possibility of a coalition involving the Center Party.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/14", "Text": "The Liberal Democrats face a challenging task at their conference, as they attempt to gain support and potentially join a coalition government.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/1", "Text": "The Electoral Commission releases a report summarizing the results of the 2017 elections and public attitudes towards voting.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/27", "Text": "Australia's government is thrown into turmoil as the country's high court rules that five politicians, including the deputy prime minister, were ineligible for election.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/28", "Text": "Iceland holds its second snap election in a year, following a series of scandals.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/6", "Text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveils the members of Canada's new National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/23", "Text": "Germany's far-right AfD party wins seats in the national parliament for the first time, but analysts say their impact on policy will be limited.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2024/July/23", "Text": "The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which follows the 2016 referendum and the triggering of Article 50, is introduced in Parliament.", "Articles": ["5"]}]}, "Pirate Party (Iceland)": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Iceland: Pirate Party leader casts snap election vote as party sees ...", "Parliamentary question | Child labour ... - European Parliament", "Nepal elections explained | Elections News | Al Jazeera", "The rise, the fall, and the resurrection of Iceland | Brookings", "A massive new study reviews the evidence on whether campaigning ... - Vox", "German and British political parties: A comparison - DW", "Catalonia elections: Separatist parties win majority | CNN", "Election 2017: Live updates | CNN Politics", "Why the 2017 German elections matter to the rest of the world - CNN", "Why Parliament led the news in 2017 - BBC News", "Iceland Mandates Mental Health Warnings on All Bibles?", "Parliamentary Salaries and Allowances Determination 2017", "In pictures: Liberia Elections 2017 | CNN", "Singaporeans miffed by 'reserved' presidential election", "BBC Parliament - Schedules, Tuesday 7 November 2017", "The curious, three-person committee in Iceland that approves and ...", "Nepal votes in key general elections | Elections News | Al Jazeera", "How to see the northern lights in Iceland | CNN", "Elections bring wins for minority, LGBT candidates | CNN", "Uganda: 2017 Raid of Parliament Worse Than 1966 Edition"], "1": {"Title": "Iceland: Pirate Party leader casts snap election vote as party sees ...", "Snippet": "Helgi Hrafn Gunnarsson of the Pirate Party Iceland cast his vote in Reykjavik, Saturday, in a snap parliamentary election, following a year of scandals that mired Icelandic politics.
