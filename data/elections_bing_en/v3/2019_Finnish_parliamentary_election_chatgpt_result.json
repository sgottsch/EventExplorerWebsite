A record number of women won seats in the new parliament, with 93 out of 200 being women (1). This was the first time in history that no party received more than 20% of the vote (19). The Centre Party, which was the largest party following the 2015 elections, dropped to fourth place with its lowest vote share since 1917 (19). The Social Democrats, led by Antti Rinne, won the election and formed a coalition government with four to five other parties (2, 5). The election in Finland was part of a larger trend of European elections in 2019 (14). In India, the 2019 general election was also held during this time, with close to a billion people participating (2, 8, 15). In Canada, Finnish citizens were able to vote in the election at six designated locations (7). Other elections in 2019 included the European Parliament Elections, held on May 24, 2019 (11, 14). The Brexit Party won three seats in the East of England region (9). In Thailand, both houses of parliament elected Prayuth Chan-ocha as the country's next prime minister (10). The outcome of the European elections in Germany was also significant, as German parliamentarians have played a decisive role in the previous legislature (12). The Finns Party, which campaigned against ambitious climate change policies, came in second in the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election (13). In Malawi, incumbent president Peter Mutharika was declared the winner of the 2019 election (18)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/April/14", "Text": "Finland holds parliamentary elections, with a record number of women winning seats.", "Articles": ["1", "19"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/16", "Text": "Finnish parliamentary elections results are announced, with no party receiving more than 20% of the vote.", "Articles": ["1", "5", "19"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/18", "Text": "Voting for the second phase of India's Lok Sabha election takes place, with 39 constituencies in Tamil Nadu up for grabs.", "Articles": ["2", "8", "15"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/23", "Text": "India's election authorities announce that a record 900 million people participated in the Lok Sabha election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/23", "Text": "Narendra Modi secures a landslide victory in India's general election.", "Articles": ["9", "15"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/27", "Text": "The Brexit Party wins three seats in the East Midlands in the European Parliament election.", "Articles": ["9", "14"]}, {"Date": "2019/June/3", "Text": "The European Parliament election results are released, with The Greens gaining 17 seats and The Finns Party gaining the second-highest number of seats.", "Articles": ["11", "14"]}, {"Date": "2019/June/5", "Text": "Thailand's parliament elects Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2019/July/24", "Text": "The European Parliament elections in Germany are held, with German parliamentarians exerting decisive influence in the previous legislature.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2019/July/24", "Text": "A Finnish political party that campaigned against ambitious climate change policies wins the second-highest number of seats in parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["13"]}]}}}
