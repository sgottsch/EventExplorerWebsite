Marek Hil\u0161er (2,3,4,9) was the youngest candidate and was known for his independence and desire for open discussion (2). The election was seen as a major battle (8) and the president's decision to confirm the Communists in power was seen as sealing the country's fate for decades to come (1). Hil\u0161er is a doctor and academic (2,4) who has worked at the University of Karlovy (2,4). His political orientation is not clearly defined (2). Zeman's victory was seen as a \\\"z\\u00e1zrak\\\" (3) and was favored by bookmakers in the second round (3). Many defeated candidates have endorsed Ji\u0159\u00ed Draho\u0161 (9) who is competing in the second round against Zeman (7,9).

Another candidate, Ji\u0159\u00ed Hynek, has been active in politics and is running for president (10). There is concern about voter turnout (3) and the potential impact of foreign influence (1,8).

Zeman, the incumbent, was sworn in for a second term in March 2018 (4). The election took place in January 2018 (5,7,9,10) and involved a runoff between Zeman and Draho\u0161 (7). Hor\u00e1\u010dek, a scientist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, also ran in the election (8). However, he was not viewed favorably by political activist John Bok, who expressed support for both Draho\u0161 and Pavlu Fischer (2). The 2018 Zl\u00edn by-election was also held in May 2018 as a result of Franti\u0161ek \u0160uba\u0161's resignation (3). Zeman, who has pro-Russian views, has been criticized for his decision to confirm the Communists in power in 1948, which sealed the country's fate for decades (1)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/November/25", "Text": "Czech citizens living in the USA prepare for the upcoming presidential election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2017/December/3", "Text": "Deadline for voter registration for the Czech presidential election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2017/December/19", "Text": "Texta\u0159 Michal Hor\u00e1\u010dek criticizes Ji\u0159\u00ed Draho\u0161 during a debate.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/December/24", "Text": "John Bok expresses his opinion on the best candidate for the Czech presidential election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2018/January/25", "Text": "Scientist Ji\u0159\u00ed Draho\u0161 challenges incumbent Milos Zeman in the Czech presidential runoff.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2018/January/27", "Text": "Pro-Russian incumbent Milos Zeman claims victory in the Czech presidential election.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2018/January/28", "Text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulates Milos Zeman on his re-election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2018/February/24", "Text": "The Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948 is discussed in relation to the upcoming presidential election.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/2", "Text": "A by-election for the Zl\u00edn Senate seat is held in the Czech Republic.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/9", "Text": "Milos Zeman vows to speed up embassy relocation to Jerusalem.", "Articles": ["4"]}]}, "Russia": {"upper_aspect": "where", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Russian opposition leader announces presidential bid - Anadolu Ajans\u0131", "A Timeline of 2017 and 2018 Elections in Latin America", "Russia\u2019s 2018 Presidential Election - EveryCRSReport.com", "Russian Presidential Elections 2018: A Shitshow - LinkedIn", "Putin re-election: Candidates run against the Russian president - USA TODAY", "Italy election 2018: If Silvio Berlusconi wins on Sunday, Russia will ...", "The Russian presidential election 2018 explained - CNN", "Russia\u2019s 2018 Presidential Election - CRS Reports", "Russian President Putin to run for re-election as an independent", "Vladimir Putin gives strongest hint yet that he will run for Russian ...", "President of Russia | Current Leader", "Artificial Intelligence Robot 'Alisa' Nominated for Russian President", "Putin says to run in Russia's 2018 presidential election", "Putin Announces 2018 Presidential Bid, Surprising No One - The Moscow Times", "Elections in the Russian Federation: 2018 Presidential Election", "Russian elections: Who is running against Vladimir Putin?", "Xi sends congratulations to Milos Zeman on re-election as Czech president", "Pro-Russia incumbent wins Czech presidential election", "Putin announces bid for 2018 Russian presidential race", "Parliamentary election 2018 in Italy - Statistics & Facts | Statista"], "1": {"Title": "Russian opposition leader announces presidential bid - Anadolu Ajans\u0131", "Snippet": "Alexey Navalny, founder of Anti-corruption Foundation, officially files application to Russia\u2019s Central Election Commission - Anadolu Ajans\u0131", "URL": "https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/russian-opposition-leader-announces-presidential-bid/1014133", "Date": "2017-12-25"}, "2": {"Title": "A Timeline of 2017 and 2018 Elections in Latin America", "Snippet": "Those were the winners in the presidential races in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela in 2006\u2014the last time Mexico and Venezuela\u2019s six-year cycles lined up with the other countries\u2019 four-year ones before 2018\u2019s electoral juggernaut.
