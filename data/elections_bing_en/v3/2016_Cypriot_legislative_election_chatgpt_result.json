The election was held on May 22, 2012 (10) and Chris Paouros, a Greek-Cypriot, was one of the 119 people standing for the London-wide Assembly in the London elections (5). The results showed that there was only one Greek-Cypriot candidate (5). In the UK, the election was seen as a game of votes (3). However, the election did not receive as much attention as other political events, such as the 2016 London Mayoral Election (2) and the Northern Ireland Assembly Election (9). In Brazil, a motion to impeach President Dilma Rousseff was passed in the country's lower house (7), but in Equatorial Guinea, President Teodoro Obiang NGUEMA has held office since 1979 and was reelected in 2016 (10). The 2016 election in Equatorial Guinea was considered a \"game\" as well, with the main opposition boycotting the election (10). Despite the focus on election results and turnout in the United States (8), the role of money in politics was also highlighted, with the Koch Brothers planning to spend $889 million on the 2016 elections (6). In addition, a hijacking incident in Egypt was also linked to a possible \"lovers' tiff\" (4)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2016-03-29", "Text": "An EgyptAir plane is hijacked and taken to Cyprus by a passenger threatening to blow himself up.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2016-04-17", "Text": "Brazil's lower house votes for President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2016-04-24", "Text": "Equatorial Guinea holds its presidential election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2016-05-07", "Text": "London holds its mayoral election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2016-05-09", "Text": "The Wire season 2 is released, featuring the phrase 'ALL IN THE GAME'.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2016-05-10", "Text": "Northern Ireland holds its assembly election.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2016-05-18", "Text": "The Koch brothers announce their plan to spend $889 million on the 2016 elections.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2016-05-19", "Text": "The winners and losers of the 2016 elections are announced.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2016-06-07", "Text": "California holds its primary elections, with a high number of voters with no political party preference.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2024-05-25", "Text": "Chris Paouros becomes the first Greek-Cypriot to be elected to the London Assembly.", "Articles": ["5"]}]}, "Progressive Party Of Working People": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Dimitris Christofias - Wikidata", "2016 presidential elections | Per\u00fa Reports", "The 2016 presidential candidates and their celebrity supporters - RAPPLER", "[PHOTOS] 2016 Electiontainment!
