The election took place against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis (11, 15), with Grybauskaite emphasizing her anti-Russia platform (3, 10, 12, 16). The president's victory was seen as historic, as she became the first Lithuanian president to be elected for a second term (12). Grybauskaite also received congratulations from international leaders and organizations (8, 14). During her campaign, Grybauskaite visited soldiers during the Saber Strike 2014 military exercise (14). The election results also included the concurrent Lithuanian European Parliament elections, which resulted in a variety of representatives (16)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2014/5/10", "Text": "Lithuania holds its presidential election, with Dalia Grybauskaite as the incumbent favorite.", "Articles": ["20"]}, {"Date": "2014/5/11", "Text": "The presidential election in Lithuania goes to a runoff, with Grybauskaite facing a second round of voting.", "Articles": ["2", "7", "18", "19"]}, {"Date": "2014/5/12", "Text": "Grybauskaite appeals to the nation for loyalty in the face of the Ukraine crisis as she heads into the second round of voting.", "Articles": ["3", "11", "15"]}, {"Date": "2014/5/25", "Text": "Grybauskaite is re-elected as president of Lithuania, defeating Social Democrat candidate Zigmantas Balcytis.", "Articles": ["1", "4", "9", "12", "17"]}, {"Date": "2014/5/26", "Text": "The concurrent Lithuanian European Parliament elections result in an array of representatives.", "Articles": ["8", "10", "16"]}, {"Date": "2014/6/10", "Text": "Grybauskaite chooses to work in Lithuania.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2014/6/17", "Text": "Grybauskaite visits soldiers during Saber Strike 2014.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2014/6/27", "Text": "German Van Rompuy makes a statement that mentions Lithuania's stance on issues with Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2024/7/25", "Text": "Grybauskaite is re-elected for a second term in Lithuania, making her the country's first president to be re-elected for a second term.", "Articles": ["4"]}]}}}
