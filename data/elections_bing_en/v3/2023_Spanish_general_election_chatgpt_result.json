The Socialist party leader, Pedro Sanchez, was nominated to seek backing for a new mandate (14).

The opposition leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, predicted an end to \"sanchismo\" and a new political era in Spain (16). The election was officially announced in November 2023 (11) and was held on November 29 (12). The opening session of the XV Legislature of the Cortes Generales was held on this day (12,18). The deadline for nominations was in December 2023 (19) and the election was set for February 8, 2024 (19). However, the election was extended due to delays at polling stations (20). The election results saw Javier Milei winning the presidency (13) and Sanchez securing a new term (2). The election also saw a surge for the far right (15). The monarchy of Spain is a constitutional form of government with a hereditary monarch (6,8)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2023/10/3", "Text": "Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez predicts 'complex talks' to form a government after being nominated to seek backing for a new mandate.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2023/10/8", "Text": "Election Day in Spain results in no clear winner, but a surge for the far right.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2023/11/16", "Text": "Pedro Sanchez is officially elected as the Spanish Prime Minister again.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2023/11/19", "Text": "Alberto Nu\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o gives his first interview as the opposition leader, calling the current government 'a parenthesis' and announcing his desire to return to power.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2023/11/22", "Text": "The 1893 Spanish general election is held, with all 401 seats in the Congress of Deputies up for election.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2023/11/29", "Text": "The XV Legislature of the Cortes Generales is opened with a Solemn Ceremony.", "Articles": ["12", "18"]}, {"Date": "2023/12/16", "Text": "The Election Commission of Pakistan unveils the schedule for the upcoming general elections in 2024.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2023/12/20", "Text": "Elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo are extended after delays at polling stations.", "Articles": ["20"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/9", "Text": "People's Party leader Alberto Nu\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o rallies for an end to 'sanchismo' and a new political era in Spain.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/11", "Text": "Wikipedia unveils a new modernized interface.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/20", "Text": "Spain's Monarchy remains a constitutional form of government.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/24", "Text": "Pakistan's former information minister announces a boycott of the upcoming general elections.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2024/7/24", "Text": "Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez applauds at the Spanish parliament's lower house in Madrid.", "Articles": ["5"]}]}}}
