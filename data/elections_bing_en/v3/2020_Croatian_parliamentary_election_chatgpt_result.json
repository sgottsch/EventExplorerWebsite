The election has been called due to the dissolution of the Croatian Parliament on May 18, 2020 (5, 15). The Constitutional Court has requested the State Electoral Commission to explain its voting ban for persons infected with COVID-19 (2, 18). The ruling conservative party, Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), is expected to win the election (6, 9, 11, 14). However, a new right-wing nationalist party, Homeland Movement, may also potentially gain a place in the governing coalition (13, 16). The election is taking place amidst the coronavirus pandemic, with an uptick in cases raising pressure on the ruling party (7, 12, 19).
