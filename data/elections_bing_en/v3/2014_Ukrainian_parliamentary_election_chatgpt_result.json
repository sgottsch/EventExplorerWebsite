The election was won by pro-Western forces, with the goal of introducing constitutional reform and establishing a \"New Turkey\" (2). The election was monitored for gender representation and it was found that women held only 8% of parliamentary seats (3,5). Ukraine has also recently experienced the appointment of three foreign-born ministers (6). The Communist Party of Ukraine is a key player in this election, with their ideology of overthrowing \"bourgeois capitalism\" (7). The election has also garnered attention from NATO, who looks forward to the formation of a representative government (8). During this time, Ukraine's prime minister stated that they are \"fixing the 350-year-old mistake\" of not being considered part of Europe (9). However, Ukraine's gold reserves have been decreasing as they struggle with the ongoing conflict with Russia (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2014/September/1", "Text": "International organizations urge Ukraine to increase women's representation in politics.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2014/September/2", "Text": "A gender monitoring report finds that women hold only 8% of parliamentary seats in Ukraine.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2014/September/5", "Text": "The Wales Summit Declaration commends Ukraine's progress in improving its security situation and its commitment to the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2024/July/10", "Text": "The Communist Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, lays out the theoretical foundation of modern communism.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2014/August/27", "Text": "A report analyzes the results of Turkey's 2014 presidential election and their implications for the country's future.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2014/August/28", "Text": "Ukraine's gold reserves are slashed by more than a third in October.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2014/September/17", "Text": "Ukraine's Prime Minister declares that the country is fixing a 350-year-old mistake by aligning itself with Europe.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2014/September/1", "Text": "Ukraine's new foreign-born ministers, including one from Georgia, receive Ukrainian citizenship.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2014/October/26", "Text": "Voting starts in Ukraine's parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2014/October/28", "Text": "Pro-Western forces are expected to win the majority of seats in Ukraine's parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["2"]}]}, "Radical Party Of Oleh Liashko": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Ukraine: Zlata Ognevich runs for Parliament with Radical Party - wiwibloggs", "Tensions Surround Ukrainian Parliamentary Elections: Russian Roulette ...", "Renewed deadly violence in eastern Ukraine \u2013 DW \u2013 09/29/2014", "Ukraine crisis: Army accused of using cluster bombs - BBC News", "After Ukraine\u2019s elections, Russia has few good options | ECFR", "Informaci\u00f3n sobre... - Antimaidan l D\u00ed no al fascismo - Facebook", "US mid-terms 2014: Results - BBC News", "Ukrainians in Estonia Back Tilt to West in Election | News | ERR", "Support for radical left parties in Western Europe: social background ...", "Ukraine and Russia Face Gaps in a Truce and a Chasm on the Issues", "Ukraine, Early Parliamentary Elections, 26 October 2014: Interim Report", "Ukraine swings West.
