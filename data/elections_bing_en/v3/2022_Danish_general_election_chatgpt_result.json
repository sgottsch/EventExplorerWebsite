This trend has been seen in other recent elections, such as in Italy where a new centre right government led by Giorgia Meloni took office in 2022 (1). In Kenya, the new president, William Ruto, has made bold moves, including ending a petrol subsidy, in his first major speech (3,6). In the United States, primary elections have resulted in notable victories for the new right, such as Andrea Campbell winning the Democratic nomination for Massachusetts attorney general (2) and Seth Magaziner winning the Democratic nomination for Rhode Island's second congressional district (5). The new right has also seen success in secretary of state elections, such as in Arizona and Illinois (8,9). In Texas, the new right has been a major focus in the 2022 elections, with the deadline to register to vote being October 11 and early voting running from October 24 to November 4 (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/September/6", "Text": "Andrea Campbell wins the Democratic nomination for Massachusetts attorney general.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/8", "Text": "The deadline to register to vote in the Texas 2022 elections passes.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/13", "Text": "William Ruto is sworn in as the new president of Kenya.", "Articles": ["3", "6"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/23", "Text": "Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary carry out UN engagements in the United States.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/26", "Text": "Italians vote in a new parliament, expected to lean towards the right.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/8", "Text": "Election results for the Arizona and Illinois Secretary of State are announced.", "Articles": ["8", "9"]}]}, "S\u00f8ren Pape Poulsen": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Italy: 2022 general election and new government", "Swedish General Election results LIVE - Radio Sweden", "Blev Pape snydt eller l\u00f8j han?

The election comes after a year of campaigning and preparations, with current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen calling for an early election (17). The election is expected to be a close race, with the right-wing bloc winning a slim majority (19). The main contenders for the election are the Venstre party, led by Jakob Ellemann-Jensen (11), and the Liberal party, led by Abid Raja (1). Other notable parties include the far-right Sweden Democrats (3) and the Brothers of Italy party (10). The election is also being closely watched by international media, with TIME magazine covering the election and its implications (3). In addition, the election has sparked discussions about same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights in Denmark, with the news of current Venstre chairman S\u00f8ren Pape Poulsen's divorce from his husband (6, 7)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/September/2", "Text": "The Swedish general election takes place, with the far-right party Sweden Democrats gaining significant support.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/9", "Text": "The Swedish general election results are announced, with the right-wing parties winning a slim majority.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/11", "Text": "The results of the Swedish general election are continuously updated on a graph.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/14", "Text": "S\u00f8ren Pape Poulsen, leader of Venstre, announces his divorce from his husband, causing controversy and speculation.", "Articles": ["6", "7"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/25", "Text": "Italy holds its general election, with the far-right party Brothers of Italy claiming victory.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/26", "Text": "Italians go to the polls to elect a new parliament.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/3", "Text": "The latest polls for the Danish general election are released, showing a slight lead for the Liberal Party.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/5", "Text": "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announces a general election for November 1st.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/7", "Text": "The Danish embassy in the UK reminds Danish nationals living abroad of the option to postal vote in the upcoming general election.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/13", "Text": "Voting for the 2022 Virginia general election begins, with in-person voting on Election Day taking place on November 8th.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/16", "Text": "The Liberal Party holds its national meeting, receiving little opposition or controversy.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/19", "Text": "Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, chairman of the Liberal Party, is pictured at a meeting.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/21", "Text": "The ballot for the 2022 Massachusetts election is announced, including statewide candidates and ballot questions.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/24", "Text": "The latest results for the general election in Macomb County, Michigan are released.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/8", "Text": "The 2022 New Jersey and Kentucky elections take place, with Republicans gaining significant victories.", "Articles": ["9", "20"]}]}}}
