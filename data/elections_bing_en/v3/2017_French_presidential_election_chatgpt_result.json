Macron has stated that he will fight to defeat far-right candidate Marine Le Pen (4). Macron has ultimately won the election (5), while Jean-Luc Melenchon, who had the support of younger and student voters, has also played a significant role in the election (6). Both Le Pen and Macron cast their ballots in the runoff election (7). The first round of the election saw Macron and Le Pen as the top two candidates (8). The election has also highlighted the characteristics of the French electorate, with Le Pen gaining support from traditional right-wing voters and Macron from younger and left-leaning voters (9,10).\n\n=== End of Summary ==="}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/April/19", "Text": "Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a far-left candidate, shakes up the 2017 French presidential election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/21", "Text": "The mystique of France's republican monarchy is lost, as shown by the struggles of both former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/22", "Text": "The first round of voting takes place, with Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen emerging as the two top candidates.", "Articles": ["8", "9"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/25", "Text": "Emmanuel Macron states that he is not taking victory for granted and will fight to defeat Marine Le Pen.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/26", "Text": "Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy endorses Emmanuel Macron for the second round of the election.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/2", "Text": "Abstention and the sociological makeup of the electorate is analyzed following the first round of the election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/7", "Text": "Emmanuel Macron wins the French presidential election, defeating Marine Le Pen.", "Articles": ["5", "7"]}]}, "Result": {"upper_aspect": "no upper aspect", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Emmanuel Macron wins French presidential election in landslide", "R\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle 2017 - Minist\u00e8re de l ...", "French Presidential Election: Poll Shows 71% of Voters Want Fillon to ...", "France\u2019s presidential election launches with an unprecedented choice of ...", "Jean-Luc Melenchon, candidate of the party France Insubmise to the ...", "French Presidential Election 2017: Voter turnout at 65.3% ... - Mint", "French presidential election: What you need to know", "Emmanuel Macron Projected To Win French Presidential Election First ...", "Emmanuel Macron defeats Le Pen to become French president", "The French Presidential election 2017 (second round)", "Ecuador election: Ruling party candidate Lenin Moreno claims win - CNN", "Why Marine Le Pen doesn\u2019t have a chance. - Slate Magazine", "France votes in presidential election amid high security", "General election 2017: How reliable are the polls? - BBC", "French presidential election results 2017 (round 1, by Department ...", "French tragedy or farce: the 2017 presidential election \u2013 1", "Emmanuel Macron vows unity after winning French presidential election ...", "Russian Imperial Guard Descendant Opts for Empty Ballot at French Election", "2017 French Presidential Elections | TIME", "Emmanuel Macron takes office as French president - Al Jazeera"], "1": {"Title": "Emmanuel Macron wins French presidential election in landslide", "Snippet": "Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential election in a landslide on Sunday, setting himself up to be the youngest president in France's history.", "URL": "https://www.businessinsider.com/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidential-election-in-landslide-marine-le-pen-2017-5", "Date": "2017-05-07"}, "2": {"Title": "R\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle 2017 - Minist\u00e8re de l ...", "Snippet": "ou cliquez sur la carte pour acc\u00e9der au d\u00e9tail des r\u00e9sultats.
