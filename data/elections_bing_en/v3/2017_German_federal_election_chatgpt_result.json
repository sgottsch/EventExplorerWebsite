Despite her party maintaining a leading position, Chancellor Angela Merkel's fourth term is now in doubt (5,20). The election saw the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union maintain their lead, but with a narrower margin (1,11). The Social Democratic Party, led by Martin Schulz, faced a decline in polls (16) and the Free Democratic Party, led by Christian Lindner, played a key role in the coalition talks (12,17)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/September/17", "Text": "The world's biggest beer festival, Oktoberfest, opens in Munich.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/19", "Text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismisses hecklers as polls point to a fourth term in office.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/22", "Text": "The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party strikes fear in the hearts of Germans after Sunday's election.", "Articles": ["2", "5"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/24", "Text": "Joachim Sauer, Angela Merkel's husband, is mostly unknown and stays out of the spotlight.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/24", "Text": "The German federal election takes place, with the AfD becoming the third strongest party and entering parliament for the first time since the 1960s.", "Articles": ["11", "13"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/25", "Text": "Official results for the 2017 German federal election are released.", "Articles": ["6", "12"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/27", "Text": "German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel equates the AfD party with Nazis.", "Articles": ["10", "13"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/3", "Text": "AfD's Beatrix von Storch states that Islam does not belong in Germany during an interview on BBC World News.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/4", "Text": "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier comments on the division among the German people after the election, with the rise of the AfD.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/8", "Text": "The 2017 German federal election results in a coalition impasse.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/20", "Text": "Angela Merkel's fourth term as chancellor is in doubt after coalition talks fail overnight.", "Articles": ["16", "18"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/21", "Text": "Angela Merkel states that she would prefer new elections to ruling with a minority after coalition talks fail.", "Articles": ["15", "19"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/21", "Text": "The leader of the Free Democrats, Christian Lindner, is determined not to repeat old mistakes, but may be making a new one.", "Articles": ["17", "20"]}]}}}
