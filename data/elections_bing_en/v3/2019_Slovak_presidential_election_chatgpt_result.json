Her victory was seen as a backlash against populism in Europe (13). Caputova's campaign logo was \"Stand up to evil\" (19). She will be Slovakia's first female president (11, 14). Despite being a political novice, Caputova had a strong lead in the polls (6, 8, 12). She was supported by young people and those with a university education (3). Her opponent, Maros Sefcovic, was backed by the ruling party (7, 9, 16).
