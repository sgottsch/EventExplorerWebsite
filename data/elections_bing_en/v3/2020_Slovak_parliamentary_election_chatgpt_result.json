The election was overshadowed by the murder of a journalist, which triggered large anti-government protests (12, 19) and led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Robert Fico (11, 17). Pellegrini, who had recently visited the Hungarian-Serbian border (3), faced criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic (7). Despite canceling his agenda due to illness (5, 20), Pellegrini signed a new law to help children with rare diseases (14). The results of the election (2, 10) showed a victory for the Ordinary People party, with Pellegrini conceding defeat (2).
