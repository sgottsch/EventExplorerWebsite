The election also saw the release of former presidential candidate Mikalay Statkevich and five other political prisoners (2). There were rumors of a potential presidential run by Joe Biden, but he ultimately did not enter the race (3). The election also highlighted the importance of the Supreme Court, with three justices over the age of 80 (4). Notably, the election also saw the rise of Republican candidate Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon (5). The event was also discussed in a Republican presidential debate on November 10, 2015 (6). The ballot access requirements for the 2016 election were also discussed, with various deadlines for candidates (7). However, not all coverage was positive, as Donald Trump's appearance on Saturday Night Live was criticized (8). In a surprising turn, a 15-year-old boy named Brady Olson, also known as Deez Nuts, gained attention for running for president (9). Finally, the election also had implications for student politics, with the CPI's student wing winning the presidential post in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2015/August/22", "Text": "Former Belarusian presidential candidate Mikalay Statkevich is released from prison.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2015/August/24", "Text": "Deez Nuts, aka Brady Olson, gains attention for his third-party campaign for president.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2015/August/25", "Text": "Joe Biden's potential bid for the 2016 presidential election becomes more likely.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/13", "Text": "All India Students' Federation wins the presidential post in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union elections.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/11", "Text": "Alexander Lukashenko wins his fifth term as president of Belarus.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/12", "Text": "Ben Carson announces his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2015/November/8", "Text": "Donald Trump's episode on Saturday Night Live airs.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2015/November/10", "Text": "The fourth Republican debate takes place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2015/November/16", "Text": "The deadline for presidential candidates to submit lists of primary candidates and filing deadlines is set.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2015/December/1", "Text": "The deadline for the secretary of state to submit lists of primary candidates and filing deadlines is reached.", "Articles": ["7"]}]}, "President Of Belarus": {"upper_aspect": "other", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["As Belarusian Election Nears, Domestic Political Situation Heats Up", "Presidential Elections in Argentina - House of Lords Library", "Burkina Faso: Presidential guards seize President, PM | CNN", "Lincoln Chafee ends Democratic bid for president", "Could Google Inc.

The election campaign included debates and free air time for candidates on television and radio (2,3,5,6). The Central Electoral Commission registered four candidates aside from Lukashenko (8,10,12). The election also garnered international attention, with the Nobel Prize in Literature being awarded to Belarusian author Svetlana Alexievich (7). Lukashenko's visit to Vietnam in December of that year was also covered in the news (11). However, there were reports of opposition supporters calling for a boycott of the election (12). The election was monitored and covered by the Belarusian Association of Journalists (18). After the election, Lukashenko pardoned all six political prisoners (8)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2015/September/1", "Text": "The Belarusian Association of Journalists releases their first monitoring report on media coverage of the 2015 presidential election.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/4", "Text": "Belarusian author Svetlana Alexievich is awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/8", "Text": "Belarus celebrates the 501st anniversary of the Battle of Orsha, a significant victory in the history of Belarus.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/10", "Text": "The Central Election Commission of Belarus registers four presidential candidates, including incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko.", "Articles": ["10", "12"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/11", "Text": "Belarusian state media announces the schedule for free air time for presidential candidates on TV and radio.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/17", "Text": "Henrik Kroner, a member of an international observer mission, praises the transparency of Belarusian election law.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/18", "Text": "The Belarusian government cracks down on domestic political opposition ahead of the presidential election.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/21", "Text": "The mobile app \"Vochy\" is released to help Belarusian citizens report election violations to independent observers.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/1", "Text": "Tatsiana Karatkevich, the only opposition candidate to accept an invitation to pre-election debates on Belsat TV, responds to questions from various political parties and organizations.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/8", "Text": "Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko begins a state visit to Vietnam.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/11", "Text": "The 2015 Belarusian presidential election takes place, and Alexander Lukashenko wins his fifth term in a landslide victory.", "Articles": ["1", "9", "19", "20"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/12", "Text": "Tatsiana Karatkevich questions the election results announced by the Central Election Commission of Belarus.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/19", "Text": "Voice of America reports that the Belarusian presidential election fell far short of international standards.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2015/December/9", "Text": "Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko begins a state visit to Vietnam.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2015/August/22", "Text": "President Lukashenko pardons all six political prisoners in Belarus.", "Articles": ["8"]}]}}}
