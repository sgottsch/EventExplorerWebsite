He was born in 1978 and has no political experience (1,2,9,10). Zelenskyy's victory reflects the public's desire for a fresh leader unconnected to the corrupt political elite (4,5). Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Zelenskyy on his win and invited him to Israel (6). Zelenskyy's inauguration took place on May 20, 2019 (7,8). Prior to the election, Zelenskyy was best known for playing the role of a president in a popular TV series (3,9,10). However, he has faced criticism for lack of a clear political program (2)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/03/14", "Text": "Ukrainian comic actor and presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy gains popularity in opinion polls.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2019/03/20", "Text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is investigated for abuse of power.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2019/03/31", "Text": "Comedian Volodymyr Zelensky leads in opinion polls ahead of the first round of the Ukrainian presidential election.", "Articles": ["4", "10"]}, {"Date": "2019/04/01", "Text": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian and political newcomer, leads in the first round of the Ukrainian presidential election.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2019/04/22", "Text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulates newly-elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and invites him to Israel.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2019/05/03", "Text": "The results of the Ukrainian presidential election are officially published, declaring Volodymyr Zelensky the winner.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2019/05/22", "Text": "Volodymyr Zelensky is inaugurated as the President of Ukraine.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2019/05/25", "Text": "Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration ceremony includes the performance of the Ukrainian national anthem.", "Articles": ["8"]}]}, "President Of Ukraine": {"upper_aspect": "other", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Ukraine president passes drug test demanded by electoral challenger", "Ukraine Amends Constitution to Cement EU, NATO Course", "Ukraine election - Reuters", "Ukrainian presidential elections 2019: the last days of the Poroshenko ...", "Ukraine security service accuses Russia of meddling in election", "2019 Indonesia elections \u2013 News, Research and Analysis \u2013 The ...", "Nigeria election 2019: Muhammadu Buhari gains commanding lead", "LIVE UPDATES: Ukraine Holds Presidential Election - 31.03.2019, Sputnik ...", "Ukraine enters uncharted waters after comedian wins presidency", "Ukraine: Presidential Elections 2019 | Global Risk Insights", "r/europe on Reddit: Ukrainian presidential election", "Poroshenko orders border guards not to let Russian observers in for ...", "Making Sense of Ukraine\u2019s Complicated, Highly Competitive Presidential ...", "Ukraine election won by landslide by COMEDIAN Volodymyr ... - The Sun", "ISW Blog: April 2019", "It's Official: Zelenskiy Declared Winner Of Presidential Election In ...", "Ukraine's election: Who are the main contenders? - CGTN", "Nigeria elections 2019: Buhari wins second term but Atiku rejects ... - CNN", "Ukraine election: Comedian Zelensky wins presidency by landslide - BBC", "Ukraine elections: Television comedian is unlikely frontrunner - RFI"], "1": {"Title": "Ukraine president passes drug test demanded by electoral challenger", "Snippet": "Ukraine's president has undergone drug and alcohol tests demanded by a comedian who is challenging him in a runoff election this month - passing both, according to preliminary results.", "URL": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/05/ukraine-president-passes-drug-test-demanded-electoral-challenger/", "Date": "2019-04-05"}, "2": {"Title": "Ukraine Amends Constitution to Cement EU, NATO Course", "Snippet": "In adenine final third reading includes parliament, a total of 334 lawmakers approved an amendments to the country's basic law, with 35 voting against", "URL": "https://ladderbreathe.autos/amendments-to-the-constitution-of-ukraine", "Date": "2019-02-07"}, "3": {"Title": "Ukraine election - Reuters", "Snippet": "Ukraine presidential election.

The election was held on April 21, 2019 (1,5,6,12,15,16) and Zelenskiy's lack of political experience (5,6,10,12,16) was a major talking point during the campaign. The election saw a record number of candidates (13) and the official results were published on May 3, 2019 (3). Zelenskiy's campaign focused on aggressive tactics (1,5,6) and a lack of substance (1). The election also saw violations in the financial reports of several candidates (14) and a high voter turnout (1,5,12,15,16). International observers were also present for the election (18)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/February/21", "Text": "Ukrainian presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy meets with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to discuss gas supplies.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2019/March/5", "Text": "The Central Electoral Commission of Ukraine registers 44 presidential candidates for the upcoming election, including Volodymyr Zelenskiy.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2019/March/22", "Text": "Pollsters reveal that Volodymyr Zelenskiy is leading in the presidential race.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2019/March/26", "Text": "Ukrainian presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy passes a drug and alcohol test demanded by his opponent.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2019/March/28", "Text": "The National Agency on Corruption Prevention finds financial violations in the reports of 17 presidential candidates, including Volodymyr Zelenskiy.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2019/March/31", "Text": "Ukrainian citizens vote in the first round of the presidential election.", "Articles": ["17", "19"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/1", "Text": "Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy wins the first round of the presidential election.", "Articles": ["10", "12", "16"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/14", "Text": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Petro Poroshenko advance to the second round of the presidential election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/19", "Text": "Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko begs for forgiveness and a second chance as polls show him facing certain defeat in the upcoming presidential election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/21", "Text": "Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy wins the second round of the presidential election, defeating incumbent President Petro Poroshenko.", "Articles": ["5", "15", "20"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/22", "Text": "Television actor and satirist Volodymyr Zelenskiy is declared the next President of Ukraine.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/3", "Text": "The official newspaper of the Verkhovna Rada publishes the results of the Ukrainian presidential election, declaring Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the elected President.", "Articles": ["3"]}]}}}
