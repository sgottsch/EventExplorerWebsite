The election results also saw the Centre-right opposition leader Petteri Orpo claim a mandate to form a new coalition government (8). The Finnish Parliament passed a bill to join NATO, which was signed into law by the Finnish president (4, 6). The election also sparked discussions about NATO ratification and its potential impact on neighboring countries (3, 9, 12, 15). The election results were also noted internationally, with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan meeting with a Finnish parliamentary delegation (11) and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan winning his fifth term in office (5, 10). The election also saw notable candidates, such as actor Riku Nieminen, fail to secure a seat in Parliament (13). The dissolution of Thailand's parliament for a May election (20) was also mentioned in relation to the Finnish election."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2023/April/2", "Text": "The Finnish parliamentary election takes place, with Sanna Marin losing her position as Prime Minister.", "Articles": ["1", "9", "10"]}, {"Date": "2023/April/3", "Text": "Marin concedes defeat in the election and steps down as party leader.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2023/April/3", "Text": "The Finnish National Coalition Party claims a mandate to form a new coalition government.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2023/April/3", "Text": "The 2023 Finnish parliamentary election is discussed in the Spanish press, with some comparing it to Spanish history.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2023/April/3", "Text": "Final approval is given for Finland's bid to join NATO, with the vote in Parliament being 184-7.", "Articles": ["4", "15"]}, {"Date": "2023/April/5", "Text": "The new Finnish government signs into law the required legal amendments for joining NATO.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2023/May/11", "Text": "Sanna Marin announces her divorce after being spotted dancing with a man in a nightclub.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2023/May/28", "Text": "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wins the presidential election, extending his rule to a third decade.", "Articles": ["5", "10"]}, {"Date": "2023/June/2", "Text": "President Tsai meets with a delegation from the Finland-Taiwan parliamentary friendship group.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2023/July/24", "Text": "Cuba holds its parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2023/November/2", "Text": "The United States holds its next presidential election.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2024/March/1", "Text": "The Finnish Parliament passes the NATO bill, bringing the country a step closer to joining the alliance.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2024/March/12", "Text": "Turkey's Supreme Election Council releases a list of parties participating in the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2024/March/20", "Text": "Thailand dissolves its parliament to make way for elections in May.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
