It was held after the European Parliament elections in 2019, which resulted in changes to the balance of power within the EU (2). In South Africa, the 2019 Elections were held on April 30 (3). In the United States, President Trump announced that a vote to replace Obamacare would happen after the 2020 election (4). In the UK, Theresa May resigned on May 24, adding further turmoil to the Brexit process (5). There was speculation about whether or not President Trump could get away with shooting someone on 5th Avenue (6). The 2020 presidential election primaries are set to begin on February 3, 2020 (7). The Republican Party has become more conservative in recent years, with the Democratic Party winning the presidency mainly by avoiding definitive positions (8). In India, a candidate for the Trinamool Congress was heard saying that violence always happens during elections (9). If NOTA (None of the Above) wins the highest number of votes in an election in India, the candidate with the second-highest number of votes is declared the winner (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/May/14", "Text": "The dates for the 2020 presidential election primaries are announced, starting with the Iowa caucus on February 3.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/24", "Text": "Theresa May resigns as UK leader, adding further turmoil to the Brexit process.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/29", "Text": "President Donald Trump makes a controversial statement about his ability to get away with shooting someone, raising questions about the 2020 election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/29", "Text": "The 2019 Latvian presidential election takes place, with results announced on May 29.", "Articles": ["1", "6"]}, {"Date": "2019/June/3", "Text": "President Trump announces that a Republican plan to replace Obamacare will be voted on after the 2020 election.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2019/July/5", "Text": "The Democratic candidate, Franklin D.

The election also sparked discussions about the impact of social media on politics (10) and the potential impact on relations with Russia (11). According to the Central Statistical Bureau, the unemployment rate in Latvia decreased during the first quarter of 2019 (15). The election also coincided with the European Parliament elections (16) and the Guatemalan presidential election (17).
