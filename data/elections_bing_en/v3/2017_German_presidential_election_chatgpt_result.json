In March, Merkel's conservative party won a regional election (5) and she called for a concerted effort with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to defend free trade (6). Merkel has been critical of President Donald Trump's trade policies (1,8) and the two met in March 2017 (10). Merkel also addressed the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference in February (4). In January 2017, she responded to Trump's trade adviser's comments on the euro being \"grossly undervalued\" (1).
