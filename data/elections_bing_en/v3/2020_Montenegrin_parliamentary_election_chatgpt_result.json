However, the victory was not without controversy as allegations of corruption and fraud were raised (9). The opposition leader immediately went to ask for the support of Metropolitan Amfilohije, a prominent figure in the Orthodox Church (1). Additionally, the parliament narrowly voted to legalize same-sex unions (3), a move that had previously failed in 2014 (3). Other countries, such as Syria (4) and Singapore (5), have also held elections during the pandemic. In Croatia, the Social Democratic Party-led coalition suffered a loss to the Croatian Democratic Union (6). The Iraqi prime minister has also called for early elections in 2021 (8). The Montenegro election has been closely watched, with the pro-Western party of President Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 narrowly losing power (9).
