The result of this election is significant for the country, as it marks a change in leadership (15). The election also received attention from international media outlets as it was seen as a test of the country's democracy (11). However, there were concerns about election integrity due to the COVID-19 pandemic (8, 12). The new president, Bzhania, took the oath of office on April 23, 2020 (15).
