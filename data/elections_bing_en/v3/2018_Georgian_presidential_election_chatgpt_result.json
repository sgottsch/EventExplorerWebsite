She was an independent candidate, while her opposition received significantly fewer votes (2). The election was held on October 22, 2018 and the results were questioned due to potential rigging (2,10). This election was part of a larger trend of women running for office in 2018 to push back against sexual misconduct (6). However, the requirement of a college degree for elected officials, as proposed in the House's draft federal constitution, has been criticized as anti-poor (7). Other notable elections in 2018 include the legislative and municipal elections in Mauritania (3), the Arizona Senate race (5), and the election of Ibrahim Mohamed Solih over incumbent Abdulla Yameen in the Maldives (8).

The incumbent president, Tamar Zhvania, was re-elected to the post (2). The opposition candidate, Grigol Vashadze, received 20% less votes and opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili called for early parliamentary elections (3). There were allegations of vote-buying and voter intimidation, leading to protests by the opposition (6). The election was deemed free, fair, and credible by the Constitutional Council (7). The election was also significant as it was the first time a female winner was possible (8). The context of the election was delicate and volatile, with ongoing armed violence in certain regions of the country (9)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/October/28", "Text": "Georgians vote in the last direct presidential election before transitioning to a parliamentary system.", "Articles": ["8", "10"]}, {"Date": "2018/November/23", "Text": "An analysis by Annamaria Kiss is published, highlighting the importance of the president's political affiliation despite limited formal competences.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2018/November/29", "Text": "Salome Zurabishvili is elected as Georgia's first female president, winning almost 60% of the vote.", "Articles": ["1", "3"]}, {"Date": "2018/December/2", "Text": "Opposition leaders and protesters claim that the president was elected with the help of vote-buying and voter intimidation.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2018/December/24", "Text": "Tamar Zhvania becomes the first person in the history of independent Georgia to be re-elected as the head of the Central Election Commission.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2018/December/25", "Text": "Zurab Japaridze, a presidential candidate, offers himself up for 'rent' as part of his campaign strategy.", "Articles": ["4"]}]}, "When": {"upper_aspect": "no upper aspect", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Analysis of Georgian presidential elections by Annamaria Kiss published ...", "Republicans were upset about election fraud - The Washington Post", "Brazil's Presidential Front-Runner Is Seriously Wounded In Attack At ...", "Gavin Newsom Is Elected Governor of California (Published 2018)", "Nevada Election Results - The New York Times", "How Russia Helped Swing the Election for Trump", "How Kyrsten Sinema Won Her Senate Seat and Pulled Off a Historic ...", "2018 midterms are the most expensive in history | CNN Politics", "Georgia\u2019s Brian Kemp Is Overseeing His Own Election - New York Magazine", "Facebook's Massive Security Breach: Everything We Know | WIRED", "The Most Important Least-Noticed Economic Event of the Decade", "Adams declared winner in presidential race, Dec. 10, 1796", "1968 Election, Won by Nixon, Still Haunts Our Politics - New York Magazine", "Lawsuit challenging Georgia election process filed by Stacey ... - PBS", "Disinformation Spreads on WhatsApp Ahead of Brazilian Election", "2018 precinct-level results: Detailed maps show how key neighborhoods ...", "Bolsonaro wins Brazil's presidential election \u2013 DW \u2013 10/28/2018", "Arizona Election Results - The New York Times", "The Crisis of Election Security - The New York Times", "What happened in the 2018 Texas midterm elections - The Texas Tribune"], "1": {"Title": "Analysis of Georgian presidential elections by Annamaria Kiss published ...", "Snippet": "Due to recent constitutional changes, the 2018 election is the last direct presidential election in Georgia.

The incumbent president, despite being a member of the ruling party, clashed with the government (7). The election sparked protests against alleged election fraud (20) and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe stated that one side had an \"undue advantage\" (17). This election was also notable for the large number of candidates, including four former presidents and a popular rock singer (16)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/10/23", "Text": "Political posters of the presidential candidates in Georgia are displayed.", "Articles": ["18", "19"]}, {"Date": "2018/10/27", "Text": "Salome Zurabishvili, the former French ambassador to Georgia, becomes an unlikely favorite for the 2018 Georgian presidential election.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2018/10/28", "Text": "The ruling party in Georgia warns of potential economic issues and a pro-government TV channel switches to emergency mode ahead of the presidential election.", "Articles": ["7", "13"]}, {"Date": "2018/10/29", "Text": "The presidential election in Georgia goes to a run-off between the two leading candidates.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2018/11/01", "Text": "The ruling party in Georgia continues to warn of potential economic issues ahead of the presidential election.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2018/11/06", "Text": "The citizens of Madagascar have a wide variety of candidates to choose from in their upcoming presidential election.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2018/11/23", "Text": "An analysis of the upcoming Georgian presidential election is published, discussing the importance of the candidate's political affiliations.", "Articles": ["3", "4"]}, {"Date": "2018/11/28", "Text": "Georgians head to the polls for a tight presidential runoff between two former foreign ministers.", "Articles": ["11", "14", "20"]}, {"Date": "2018/11/29", "Text": "Salome Zurabishvili is elected as Georgia's first female president.", "Articles": ["1", "2", "8", "17"]}, {"Date": "2019/01/03", "Text": "The 2020 United States presidential election in Georgia is briefly mentioned in an article about another topic.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2023/05/25", "Text": "Exit polls show that the ruling party candidate has won the presidential runoff election in Georgia.", "Articles": ["9"]}]}}}
