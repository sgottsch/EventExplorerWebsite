There are three lists of candidates, including Horizon Monaco which is headed by a woman, B\u00e9atrice Fresko-Rolfo (1). The election will determine the 24 members of the National Council (1,2). The current party in power, Union Mon\u00e9gasque, is being challenged by Primo!, led by St\u00e9phane Valeri (19). This election is significant as it is the only major electoral event in Monaco until 2055 (8)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/February/8", "Text": "DG Consultants, a subsidiary of Comexposium, takes over the Monaco Cybersecurity Summit from Oxygen.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2018/February/11", "Text": "The Monaco municipal elections take place.", "Articles": ["3", "9"]}, {"Date": "2018/February/12", "Text": "Stephane Valeri and his party, Primo!, sweep 21 out of 24 seats in the National Council elections.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2018/February/14", "Text": "The Monaco delegation is announced for the 2018 Winter Olympics.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2018/February/22", "Text": "EveryPolitician releases a dataset on the members of the National Council for the 2018-2023 term.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2018/January/4", "Text": "The election campaigns for the Monaco National Council take place.", "Articles": ["1", "2"]}, {"Date": "2018/January/22", "Text": "Monaco adopts a new Code on Private International Law.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2018/January/29", "Text": "The presidential election campaigns in Chile and Egypt commence.", "Articles": ["7", "13", "15"]}, {"Date": "2018/January/30", "Text": "The Ordonnance Souveraine is released, granting citizenship to Audrey Presburger.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2018/February/25", "Text": "Fougasse.org publishes an article about the traditional Mon\u00e9gasque bread, the fougasse.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/30", "Text": "The Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Minist\u00e9riel approves the statutes of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Mon\u00e9gasque ENTREPRISE G\u00c9N\u00c9RALE INSOBAT.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2018/April/2", "Text": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi wins the presidential election in Egypt, with 97% of the vote.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2018/April/9", "Text": "Viktor Orban's Fidesz party wins the Hungarian parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
