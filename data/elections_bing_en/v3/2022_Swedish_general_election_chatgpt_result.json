The Social Democratic Party, which had been in power, suffered its longest period in opposition since the 1910s (2). The election was held after the fall of the Draghi government and resulted in a centre-right coalition (3,8). The Swedish Democrats, led by Jimmie \u00c5kesson, gained a national following during the early days of the pandemic (6). \u00c5kesson's party, however, was not invited to the 2022 Nobel Prize ceremony (19). During the campaign, \u00c5kesson expressed admiration for Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Donald Trump (15). He also stated that he was not sure who he preferred between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin (15)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/08/14", "Text": "Jimmie \u00c5kesson expresses his support for continued immigration in an interview.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2022/08/15", "Text": "In an interview, Jimmie \u00c5kesson says that he is not opposed to having the Liberals in a coalition government.", "Articles": ["20"]}, {"Date": "2022/08/21", "Text": "Kalmar is a stop on Jimmie \u00c5kesson's campaign tour.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2022/08/26", "Text": "Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson is interviewed on Morgonpasset i P3.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2022/09/14", "Text": "Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson holds a news conference in Stockholm.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2022/09/15", "Text": "Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson announces his intention to form a new government.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2022/09/24", "Text": "Jimmie \u00c5kesson is not expected to become Prime Minister.", "Articles": ["17", "15"]}, {"Date": "2022/09/25", "Text": "The Democratic Party concedes defeat in the election.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2022/10/03", "Text": "Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo is awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work in paleogenomics.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2022/10/14", "Text": "Ulf Kristersson is named Prime Minister.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2022/10/17", "Text": "Ulf Kristersson is elected Prime Minister by the Swedish Parliament.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2022/10/19", "Text": "Jimmie \u00c5kesson is interviewed on SVT Play.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2022/10/20", "Text": "The Swedish Social Democratic Party wins the general election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2022/10/21", "Text": "Giorgia Meloni claims victory in the Italian parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2022/10/25", "Text": "The Sweden Democrats are not invited to the 2022 Nobel Prize banquet.", "Articles": ["18"]}]}}}
