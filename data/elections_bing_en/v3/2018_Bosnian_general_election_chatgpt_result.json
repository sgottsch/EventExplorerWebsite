The far-right party made gains in Sweden's general election (6), and the issue of election interference was raised in the US (4). In Cameroon, guidelines were put in place to ensure fair voting practices (7). In Madagascar, the official results of the first round of the presidential election were proclaimed on November 28 (5). In Toronto, mayoral candidates were asked about their positions on major issues ahead of the election on October 22 (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/October/7", "Text": "Bosnia and Herzegovina holds its general election for 2018.", "Articles": ["1", "9"]}, {"Date": "2018/October/2", "Text": "Election campaign guidelines state that all Cameroonian nationals over the age of 20 are eligible to vote in the presidential elections.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2018/September/12", "Text": "President Trump signs a measure to punish foreign entities for interfering in US elections, in light of the upcoming Bosnian general election.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2018/September/10", "Text": "Sweden experiences political deadlock as the far-right party gains ground in its general election, foreshadowing the Bosnian presidential elections.", "Articles": ["6"]}]}, "Bosnian Parliamentary Elections 2018": {"upper_aspect": "other", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["AS IT HAPPENED: Bavarian Elections 2018 - The Local", "A Timeline Showing the Full Scale of Russia\u2019s Unprecedented ...", "2018 Connecticut Election Results : NPR", "2018 Utah Election Results : NPR", "Connecticut Election Results - The New York Times", "2018 North Carolina Election Results : NPR", "R\u00e9sultats des \u00e9lections Qu\u00e9bec 2018 | La Presse", "Elections in America: Concerns Over Security, Divisions Over Expanding ...", "Montana Election Results - The New York Times", "Compulsory voting and ethnic diversity increase invalid voting while ...", "Wisconsin Primary Election Results - The New York Times", "2018 Ohio Election Results : NPR", "Rule of law in Hungary: Parliament calls on the EU to act", "2018 November General Election - Oklahoma.gov", "Oklahoma Election Results - The New York Times", "Illinois Election Results - The New York Times", "Election results 2018: States legalize marijuana, felon voting rights", "Minnesota Election Results 2018: Midterm Results & Polls - NBC News", "\u00c9lections communales 2018 - R\u00e9sultats officiels - Uccle", "Afghans vote in parliamentary elections under threat by Taliban"], "1": {"Title": "AS IT HAPPENED: Bavarian Elections 2018 - The Local", "Snippet": "On Sunday polling stations for the Bavarian elections opened and around 9.5 million citizens, including 600,000 first-time voters, were called upon to elect a new state parliament for the next ...", "URL": "https://www.thelocal.de/20181014/live-blog-bavarian-elections-2018", "Date": "2018-10-14"}, "2": {"Title": "A Timeline Showing the Full Scale of Russia\u2019s Unprecedented ...", "Snippet": "On July 13, 2018, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election issued an indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers in the hacking of the Democratic National ...", "URL": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/20/us/politics/russia-trump-election-timeline.html", "Date": "2018-09-20"}, "3": {"Title": "2018 Connecticut Election Results : NPR", "Snippet": "Live election results: Get the latest on Connecticut's ballot measures and races for governor, Senate and House.", "URL": "https://www.npr.org/2018/11/06/654489902/2018-connecticut-midterm-election-results", "Date": "2018-11-06"}, "4": {"Title": "2018 Utah Election Results : NPR", "Snippet": "2018 Utah Election Results Live election results: Get the latest on Utah's ballot measures and races for governor, Senate and House.
