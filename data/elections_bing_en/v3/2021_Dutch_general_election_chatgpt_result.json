The election was held amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with Prime Minister Mark Rutte indicating his intention to lead a new government (1). The election also came after the Dutch government resigned in January (2,6,10) following a child benefits scandal (6,10). In the election, the Conservative party, VVD, won with 21.9% of the vote (11). Other parties that performed well were D66 (14.9%) and PVV (10.9%) (11). However, the election was not the only important one in 2021, as there were also elections for PCC (3), Senate seats in the US (4), and mayor and gubernatorial positions (5). Other notable elections in 2021 included those in Germany (7,18), Uganda (8), and Pakistan (19). The election in Laos, however, was deemed \"pointless\" (13). The 2021 Dutch general election was also held amidst other political events, such as the violence that occurred during COVID curfew protests (12) and the delay of Iraq's general election to October (17)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2021/01/14", "Text": "The Dutch government resigns over a child benefits scandal.", "Articles": ["2", "6", "10", "14"]}, {"Date": "2021/01/15", "Text": "The Dutch government continues to lead the country's COVID-19 response team until the scheduled March elections.", "Articles": ["2", "5"]}, {"Date": "2021/01/16", "Text": "Armin Laschet is elected leader of Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU).", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2021/01/19", "Text": "Iraq's cabinet unanimously votes to postpone the general election to October 10th.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2021/01/24", "Text": "Dutch COVID curfew protests turn violent.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2021/01/26", "Text": "A police vehicle is parked near a torched coronavirus testing facility in the Dutch fishing village of Urk.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2021/02/01", "Text": "Min Aung Hlaing seizes power in a military coup in Myanmar.", "Articles": ["20"]}, {"Date": "2021/02/04", "Text": "Trump runs a campaign to spoil the election, insisting that mail ballots were a Democratic plot.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2021/02/15", "Text": "Trump's campaign to spoil the election continues.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2021/03/04", "Text": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf wins 18 seats in Senate elections.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2021/03/19", "Text": "Dutch Legislative Elections take place.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2021/04/02", "Text": "Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte survives a no-confidence vote.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2021/05/08", "Text": "The Conservatives win the election for the post of police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Leicestershire.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2021/06/06", "Text": "Youssef Zaghba is identified as the third perpetrator of the London Bridge and Borough Market attack.", "Articles": ["1"]}]}}}
