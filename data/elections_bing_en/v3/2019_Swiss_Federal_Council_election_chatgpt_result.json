This was preceded by the federal election on October 20, 2019 (2). The Green parties celebrated historic wins in the election, potentially earning a place in the Federal Council (11). However, the election was not considered the most important vote in the country due to Switzerland's unique form of democracy (16). The Swiss Federal Council has also published a draft DLT-law following a public consultation in March 2019 (17). The election results saw the Conservative party win a landslide majority (13), while the left-wing Green party won a record number of additional seats (15)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/10/20", "Text": "The Swiss federal election is held, followed by the election for the Swiss Federal Council on December 11.", "Articles": ["1", "2"]}, {"Date": "2019/10/17", "Text": "Swiss political parties are active on social media in the lead-up to the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2019/10/14", "Text": "Kais Saied wins the Tunisian presidential election.", "Articles": ["10", "16"]}, {"Date": "2019/10/21", "Text": "The left-wing Greens win 17 additional seats in the Swiss parliamentary election, setting a new record.", "Articles": ["11", "15"]}, {"Date": "2019/11/21", "Text": "Labour launches its 'radical' manifesto for the UK general election.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2019/11/29", "Text": "The BBC holds a debate with the leaders of all major parties contesting the UK general election.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2019/12/13", "Text": "The Conservative party, led by Boris Johnson, wins a landslide majority in the UK general election.", "Articles": ["9", "13", "14"]}, {"Date": "2019/12/17", "Text": "The Swiss Federal Council publishes a draft DLT-law after a public consultation.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2023/09/17", "Text": "Switzerland holds its 2011 federal election.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2022/02/17", "Text": "The writer takes a winter trip to Zermatt in Switzerland, during which he/she celebrates his/her 5th anniversary in the country.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2023/02/09", "Text": "The writer takes a winter hike in Zermatt, Switzerland, using a day ticket.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2019/10/24", "Text": "Roman Karavia creates an Observable on the Swiss National Elections 2019.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2019/10/08", "Text": "The Swiss Federal Council halts its automatic exchange of information with Bulgaria due to data security concerns.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
