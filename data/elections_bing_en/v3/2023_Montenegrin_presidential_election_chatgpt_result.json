The incumbent president is seeking re-election (4) but is facing competition from retired general Pavel (2) and newcomer Jakov Milatovic (13). A second round of voting will take place if no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote (5). The election has sparked interest in the media, with several news articles covering the candidates and the voting process (1,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,19,20). The election is also being closely watched by other countries, as it is seen as a test of Montenegro's commitment to democracy and its relationship with the West (13)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2023/January/20", "Text": "The Philippine presidential and vice presidential elections are held, with partial and unofficial results being transmitted through the Comelec transparency server.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2023/January/21", "Text": "Retired general Petr Pavel leads in a poll ahead of the Czech presidential election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/1", "Text": "An election official uses the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System during Nigeria's presidential election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/3", "Text": "A list of all 18 presidential candidates for Nigeria's upcoming election is released.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/12", "Text": "Cyprus politician Nikos Christodoulides wins the presidential vote.", "Articles": ["7", "12"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/16", "Text": "Senegal announces that its next presidential election will be held on February 25, 2024.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/17", "Text": "The United States' controversial President Donald Trump is impeached for the second time.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/20", "Text": "A number of opposition parties demand that the presidential election in Nigeria be scrapped due to widespread irregularities.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/22", "Text": "A man in Nigeria walks past electoral campaign posters ahead of the upcoming presidential election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/25", "Text": "Millions of Nigerians head to the polls to decide who will replace President Muhammadu Buhari.", "Articles": ["15", "16"]}, {"Date": "2023/February/26", "Text": "Collation of the presidential and parliamentary election results is set to commence at midday.", "Articles": ["8", "20"]}, {"Date": "2023/March/3", "Text": "Pakistan announces that the general election for the Provincial Assembly of Punjab will be held on April 30.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2023/March/17", "Text": "The Montenegrin president dissolves parliament as MPs fail to form a government, leading to a call for parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2023/March/19", "Text": "Montenegro goes to the polls in a presidential election, with a runoff election scheduled for next month.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2023/April/2", "Text": "Economist Milatovic and President Djukanovic face off in the 8th presidential election in Montenegro since the country transitioned to a multi-party system in 1990.", "Articles": ["5", "13"]}]}}}
