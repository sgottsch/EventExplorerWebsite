The election took place in April 2021 (1, 6) and was observed by the OSCE (2). This election marks the first time since 2016 that Kosovo has held a presidential election (4). The election was also notable for the participation of multiple female candidates (6). In the past, Kosovo has had a female president, Atifete Jahjaga, who served from 2011 to 2016 (1). This election was also significant due to the involvement of former reggae star Bobi Wine as a candidate (10). There were concerns about potential fraud in the election (13, 19), but the results were ultimately accepted (19). The election was held amid ongoing tensions with Serbia (7)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2021/January/14", "Text": "Bobi Wine, a popular musician and politician, challenges incumbent Yoweri Museveni in Uganda's presidential election.", "Articles": ["10", "12"]}, {"Date": "2021/January/16", "Text": "Museveni is declared the winner of the Ugandan presidential election, despite allegations of fraud.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2021/February/14", "Text": "The anti-establishment party Vetevendosje wins a majority in Kosovo's parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2021/March/18", "Text": "Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte claims victory in the country's election and secures a fourth term.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2021/April/4", "Text": "Kosovo holds indirect elections for president, with three rounds of voting before Vjosa Osmani is declared the winner.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2021/April/5", "Text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a law allowing him to run for two more terms in office.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2021/April/13", "Text": "Patrice Talon is re-elected as president of Benin with 86% of the vote.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2021/April/5", "Text": "Vjosa Osmani is officially elected as the second female president of Kosovo.", "Articles": ["1"]}]}}}
