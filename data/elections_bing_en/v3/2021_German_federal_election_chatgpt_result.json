The center-left Social Democrats (1) and the Greens (5) are currently presenting a united front in the campaign, with Olaf Scholz of the SPD being seen as the clear winner in the final TV debate (1). There have been concerns about the legitimacy of the election due to conspiracy theories (11) and claims that the German state is illegitimate (11). Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the former CDU leader and current Defense Minister, has been criticized for her handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan (8,10,15). She has also spoken out against the idea of allowing party members to vote on the future leadership of the CDU (19). The election is seen as a turning point in German politics, as Angela Merkel will not be running for reelection after 16 years as Chancellor (3,6). The German military will be operating evacuation flights from Kabul (14,18) and will be led by a three-party coalition after the election (6)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2021/August/9", "Text": "German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer praises the soldiers involved in the evacuation mission in Afghanistan.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2021/August/17", "Text": "The German military begins operating three evacuation flights a day from Kabul, Afghanistan.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2021/August/23", "Text": "The RTL program 'RTL Direkt' airs a debate between German Chancellor candidates Annalena Baerbock, Armin Laschet, and Olaf Scholz.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2021/August/27", "Text": "German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer visits a mobile rescue center in Wei\u00dfenfels, Germany to observe the care of wounded soldiers.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2021/September/20", "Text": "The final TV debate before the German federal election takes place, with the center-left Social Democrats and Greens presenting a united front.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2021/September/24", "Text": "Ahead of the German federal election, conspiracy theories spread online, including claims that the poll will be invalid because the German state is illegitimate.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2021/September/25", "Text": "The three German Chancellor candidates, Armin Laschet, Annalena Baerbock, and Olaf Scholz, answer questions from voters in a televised event.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2021/September/26", "Text": "The German federal election takes place, with the Social Democrats narrowly beating the Christian Democrats.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2021/October/6", "Text": "Olaf Scholz is sworn in as Chancellor, leading a three-party coalition after 16 years of Angela Merkel's rule.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2021/October/13", "Text": "Former CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer expresses her opposition to a proposal for party members to vote on the next party leader.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2021/October/24", "Text": "Former CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer criticizes a member of the Green Party for comments about nuclear weapons.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/8", "Text": "The German federal election takes place.", "Articles": ["4"]}]}}}
