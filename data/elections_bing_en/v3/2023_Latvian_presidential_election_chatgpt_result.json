The election is similar to the US presidential election, which also takes place in 2024 (2,5). In Singapore, eligible voters are required by law to vote in elections (3). In Liberia, the 2023 presidential election will take place amid growing anger over corruption and the cost of living (6). The election cycle for the US presidential election begins as early as two years before the general election (7). The candidates for the 2024 US presidential election will participate in debates starting in late 2023 (8). The election process involves primaries, which vary by state and can be open or closed (9). After the 2020 US presidential election, some states reworked their mail-in ballot processes to deliver results faster (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2023/June/3", "Text": "Edgars Rinkevi\u010ds is elected as the new Latvian president.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2023/October/10", "Text": "Liberia holds its presidential election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2023/December/22", "Text": "Eligible voters are required to vote in the Singapore General Elections.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2024/January/9", "Text": "Explainer: Presidential primaries are held and open to voters in certain states.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2024/January/20", "Text": "The Electoral College system is used to determine the U.S. presidential election winner.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2024/January/21", "Text": "New data from pollsters about the upcoming presidential election is released.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2024/February/14", "Text": "Prabowo Subianto claims victory in the Indonesian presidential election.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2024/February/27", "Text": "After the 2020 election, some states rework how they process mail-in ballots.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2024/March/22", "Text": "Important dates and deadlines for the 2024 presidential race are tracked.", "Articles": ["7", "8"]}]}, "Global_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Latvian Parliament elects foreign minister as new president - Yahoo Finance", "Edgars Rinkevics elected Latvia's new president - SHINE News", "Czech Republic Elects Petr Pavel President Over Andrej Babis - The New ...", "Estonia's leaders congratulate Edgars Rinkevi\u010ds as new Latvian president", "President of Latvia to address the European Parliament", "DR Congo election: President Felix Tshisekedi declared landslide ... - BBC", "The Russian presidential election: The who, what and when", "10 questions ahead of the 2024 election : NPR", "Indonesia\u2019s new president, explained - Vox", "Presidential experts rank all 45 U.S. Presidents from best to worst ...", "Finland\u2019s presidential election won by ex-prime minister Alexander ...", "EP Elections 2014 | Centr\u0101l\u0101 v\u0113l\u0113\u0161anu komisija", "Madagascar president re-elected as opposition denounces irregularities ...", "Three-way contest underway for Singapore\u2019s ninth president - \u5546\u4e1a\u65f6\u62a5", "European Elections 2024 | News | European Parliament", "Constitutional court of the Republic of Latvia", "Madagascar\u2019s Rajoelina re-elected president in poll boycotted by opposition", "Latvian PM: Baltics seeking unified position on Russian elections - ERR", "\u2018Nothing changes\u2019: Argentine voters express exasperation ahead of elections", "DR Congo election 2023: All you need know about Democratic ... - BBC", "Factbox-Candidates for Indonesia's Presidential Election", "Latvia's President Says West Must Arm Ukraine to Keep Russia From ...", "Presidential election: 6 things to know before going to the polls", "Madagascar President Rajoelina to seek re-election in November", "Latvian president visits Yahidne village, known as site of mass Russian ...", "For president, Argentina to choose between anger and fear", "Hungarian parliament elects new president after predecessor resigned in ...", "Guide to voting in the Singapore Presidential Election 2023 - Time Out", "Egypt presidential elections: Here\u2019s what you need to know", "What to Know About Indonesia\u2019s Election - The New York Times", "Indonesia election results updates: Prabowo claims presidential race ...", "Singapore Presidential Election 2023: Voting Continues, Latest Updates ...", "Comprehensive national defence exercise Namejs 2023 takes place in Latvia", "Campaigning gets underway for Indonesia's presidential election", "Putin approves new media restrictions ahead of presidential election ...", "Rwanda sets July election date for presidential and parliamentary polls ...", "Argentina election: front runner vows to slash science funding - Nature", "Latvia's president says West must arm Ukraine to keep Russia from ...", "Indonesia\u2019s first presidential debate: Five key takeaways", "The Presidents of Ukraine and Latvia discussed the continued delivery ...", "Tshisekedi re-elected DR Congo president as opposition calls vote a ...", "Who's Running for President?
