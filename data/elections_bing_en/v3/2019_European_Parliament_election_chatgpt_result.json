However, Weber faced backlash and opposition from other parties, including Orban's Fidesz, and his victory is not guaranteed (2, 6, 12). Weber's campaign emphasized his strong stance against populism and extremism in Europe (1, 5). He also promised to end EU membership talks with Turkey if elected as Commission President (9). Despite being relatively unknown among Europeans, Weber continues to push for his candidacy and garner support (3, 7, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/April/2", "Text": "Manfred Weber, the top candidate for the European People's Party, campaigns in Belgium, Ireland, and Denmark.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/23", "Text": "Manfred Weber discusses his campaign to become European Commission President.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/3", "Text": "Manfred Weber participates in a Eurovision Live-Debate as a candidate for the European Commission presidency.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/11", "Text": "An article discusses Manfred Weber's relatively unknown status among Europeans.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/15", "Text": "Manfred Weber shares the stage with other candidates for the European Commission presidency during a debate.", "Articles": ["19", "20"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/26", "Text": "Manfred Weber gives a statement on election night.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/27", "Text": "Manfred Weber expresses gratitude for support in the European elections.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/31", "Text": "A survey shows that Manfred Weber has received unexpected support from German voters in the European elections.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2019/June/4", "Text": "Manfred Weber's status as a top candidate for the European Commission presidency is discussed.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2019/July/3", "Text": "Manfred Weber's failure in Brussels is seen as a defeat for the CSU.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
