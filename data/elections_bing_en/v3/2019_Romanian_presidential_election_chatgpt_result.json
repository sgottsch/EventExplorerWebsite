One aspect of the election was the candidacy of Dan Barna, the leader of the Union to Save Romania party (6). In a USR poll, it was found that an investigation against Barna had affected his campaign (3). In the election, incumbent President Klaus Iohannis, supported by Barna's party, won with 53% of the vote (5). However, Barna also faced criticism for supporting the ousting of the government in a no-confidence vote (6). The election was one of many held around the world in 2019, including in Sri Lanka (7). In the aftermath of the election, Romanian lawmaker Maria Eugenia Barna expressed support for the 2019 Iran protests (8). The election was seen as an opportunity to continue anti-corruption efforts in Romania (9). In a similar election, Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the UK (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/10/6", "Text": "Dan Barna, candidate for the Romanian presidential election, gives an interview discussing the relationship between Romania and Moldova.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2019/10/10", "Text": "Dan Barna, leader of the opposition party Union to Save Romania, calls for the ousting of the current government.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2019/10/25", "Text": "A USR poll measures the impact of the investigation against Dan Barna on his presidential campaign.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2019/11/5", "Text": "Results from the 2019 Mississippi General Election are released.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2019/11/11", "Text": "Provisional results from the 2019 Romanian presidential election show Klaus Iohannis of the National Liberal Party as the winner.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2019/11/16", "Text": "Sri Lanka holds its third Presidential election since the end of a decades-long civil war in 2009.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2019/11/24", "Text": "Klaus Iohannis is re-elected as the President of Romania, with a two-to-one lead over his socialist challenger.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2019/11/29", "Text": "The long-awaited trial over the 1989 Revolution deaths begins in Romania.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2019/12/13", "Text": "Boris Johnson delivers a victory speech after his Conservative party wins a landslide majority in the UK general election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2019/12/16", "Text": "Maria Eugenia Barna, a Romanian lawmaker, expresses her support for the nationwide protests in Iran.", "Articles": ["8"]}]}, "Klaus Iohannis": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Romanian President Confident of Clinching Second Term", "#Romania eleksyon prezidansy\u00e8l 2019: Prezidan akty\u00e8l n\u00f2t istorik genyen ...", "#2019PresidentialElection/ IRES exit poll: Klaus Iohannis - 66.5pct ...", "Romania President Wins New Term Vowing End to Years of Chaos", "#2019PresidentialElection/AEP - provisional data (nationwide ...", "#2019PresidentialElection/Provisional results after vote count in all ...", "Romania presidential elections: Former EP president endorses president ...", "Iohannis Reelected President On Pledge To Build 'Modern, European' Romania", "Romania - President Addresses General Debate, 74th Session", "Romanian President Nominates PNL\u2019s Ludovic Orban as Premier", "Exit Poll Shows Romania's Iohannis Wins 2nd Term in Runoff", "Klaus Iohannis a votat: \u201eRom\u00e2nii decid ce viitor va avea Rom\u00e2nia\u201d", "2019 presidential election.

The election was seen as a battle between Iohannis' promise to bring \"normality\" to the country and Dancila's promise of \"change\" (5). Iohannis received endorsements from various politicians, including former European Parliament President Antonio Tajani (8). The election was held in the midst of a dour campaign (1, 2), but Iohannis remained confident in his chances of winning (1). The election was also held in record numbers, with many Romanians abroad casting their ballots (16). Iohannis' victory was seen as a win for a \"modern, European\" Romania (9). The election also saw the participation of other candidates such as Theodor Paleologu (2, 13, 15, 18), who was seen as a potential threat by other politicians (2).
