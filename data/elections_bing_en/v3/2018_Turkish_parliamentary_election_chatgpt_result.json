One aspect of this event is the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum, which is still a contentious issue in Turkish politics. The main opposition candidate, Muharrem Ince, has promised to create a new constitution and promote national cohesion and harmony (1). This is in line with the constitutional role of the Upper House, which gives equal representation to all federating units (2). The referendum and its outcome have also had an impact on the Kurdish region, with Iraqi Kurds voting for independence in a non-binding referendum in 2017 (3). The recent parliamentary election in Iraq saw Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr taking the lead (4). In addition, the OSCE has sent a Needs Assessment Mission to Luxembourg in preparation for their parliamentary election in 2018 (5). The impact of these elections on the US and the rest of the world is still to be seen, but it is clear that the results will have far-reaching consequences. In other parts of the world, elections have also been making headlines, such as the recent re-election of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro amid claims of vote-rigging (6). Meanwhile, in the US, the election of Turkish President Erdogan has raised concerns about the growing power of authoritarian leaders (7). The New York Times has also highlighted the potential impact of these elections on the Erdogan Supremacy (8). In Lebanon, the Iran-backed Hezbollah group and its allies won the majority of seats in the first parliamentary election in nine years (9). These elections have been a critical test for the country, which has been plagued by conflict with ISIS and political fragmentation (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/June/24", "Text": "Minnesota native found dead in Manhattan condo trash compactor.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/25", "Text": "The Erdogan Supremacy is discussed following Turkey's parliamentary and presidential elections.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2018/April/25", "Text": "Iraqi Kurds vote overwhelmingly for independence in a non-binding referendum.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/11", "Text": "Iraqis choose representatives for Parliament in a critical test election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/13", "Text": "The Senate of Pakistan holds elections, in line with its constitutional role.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/14", "Text": "Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr makes a strong showing in Iraq's parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/20", "Text": "Muharrem Ince, the presidential nominee of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party, pledges a new constitution and separation of powers.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/21", "Text": "Venezuela's President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro wins re-election amid claims of vote-rigging.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2018/July/24", "Text": "The OSCE undertakes a Needs Assessment Mission to Luxembourg in preparation for its parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/07", "Text": "The Iran-backed Hezbollah group and allies win a majority of seats in Lebanon's parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["9"]}]}, "Republican People'S Party": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Erdogan Begins New Term and Names His Son-in-Law Finance Minister", "Malaysia election: Opposition scores historic victory - BBC", "Results of the Turkish Presidential Election of 2018 : r/MapPorn - Reddit", "\u00c7ank\u0131r\u0131 Karatekin \u00dcniversitesi Karatekin Edebiyat Fak\u00fcltesi Dergisi ...", "Turkey: Six candidates to run for presidency - Anadolu Ajans\u0131", "Get Ready for a More Aggressive Turkey \u2013 Foreign Policy", "Unfair play: Central government spending under Turkey\u2019s AK Party", "Turkey: Why did Erdogan call early elections? - Al Jazeera", "CHP Youth - Turkish Republican People's Party (CHP) has... - Facebook", "Here Are Five Reasons Why the Malaysian Elections Matter", "Turkey's Elections May Be Imperfect But They Still Matter | TIME", "Pakistan Elections 2018: PTI wins 115 NA seats as ECP releases final tally", "Revised General Elections Electoral Register- April 2018", "PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN HUNGARY, 2018 | Hungarian Review", "Turks abroad vote at record level in elections | Reuters", "Everything you need to know about Turkey\u2019s elections - Anadolu Ajans\u0131", "Turkish opposition nominate candidates for president | AP News", "Turkey's Erdogan wins sweeping new powers after election victory", "Turkish elections Sunday will create a problem for the world - a re ...", "Turkey's Iyi Party opposition leader to step down | Reuters"], "1": {"Title": "Erdogan Begins New Term and Names His Son-in-Law Finance Minister", "Snippet": "Leaders of opposition parties, who accused Mr. Erdogan of taking an authoritarian turn, refused to stand as the president of Turkey took his oath before Parliament.", "URL": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/world/europe/turkey-erdogan-sworn-in.html", "Date": "2018-07-09"}, "2": {"Title": "Malaysia election: Opposition scores historic victory - BBC", "Snippet": "Malaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, where the party that gets the most seats in parliament wins even if it does not win the popular vote.

The main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), nominated Muharrem Ince as their candidate (8,18). The election was held earlier than scheduled, after Erdogan announced plans to bring it forward from November 2019 (3). The election was met with controversy, as many opposition parties and outside observers doubted its fairness (12,13,19). The CHP's manifesto focused on fixing fundamental problems in Turkey, including the economy and democracy (2). Prior to the election, there were reports of violence and tension during campaigning (11,20). The final results were announced by Turkey's Supreme Election Board on July 4 (15)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/June/7", "Text": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan denies allegations of growing during the time of the FET\u00d6.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/27", "Text": "Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the leader of the Republican People's Party, unveils the party's election manifesto.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/24", "Text": "Turkey holds presidential and parliamentary elections, with the presidential elections being held for the first time after constitutional amendments were approved in a 2017 referendum.", "Articles": ["3", "4", "9"]}, {"Date": "2018/July/8", "Text": "Turkey dismisses 18,000 public workers in an emergency decree.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2018/July/9", "Text": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan begins a new term as president of Turkey and names his son-in-law as the new finance minister.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2018/July/17", "Text": "Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu shares a cartoon on Twitter criticizing the detention of ODT\u00dc students.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/20", "Text": "Muharrem Ince, the presidential nominee of the Republican People's Party, pledges in his manifesto to address fundamental problems in Turkey and focus on the economy, democracy, education, foreign policy, and peace in society.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2024/July/23", "Text": "Venezuela holds presidential elections amidst a political, economic, and social crisis.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/26", "Text": "Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu responds to allegations of him resigning, saying that all members of the Republican People's Party will discuss and debate the issue among themselves.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/13", "Text": "Iraq holds parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2018/July/4", "Text": "Turkey's Supreme Election Board announces final results in the June 24 presidential and parliamentary elections, confirming Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's victory.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/24", "Text": "The European Parliament deploys an election observation mission for Turkey's early presidential and parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/14", "Text": "Campaigning for the presidential and parliamentary elections in Turkey turns violent, resulting in four deaths and eight injuries.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
