The ANC joined other parties in the election, including the Civil Contract party led by acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan (8,9). The election took place on June 20, 2021 (8,10). The ANC's leader, Ter-Petrosyan, held a press conference on June 10, 2021 (1). The party also launched its pre-election campaign on June 7, 2021 (5). On June 18, 2021, Ter-Petrosyan stated that a \"steel revolution\" would replace the Velvet Revolution in the country (6). The election was viewed as a historic event, as it followed months of protests calling for Pashinyan's resignation (10). The government faced a $1.2 billion arbitration claim from a Cyprus-registered company that owns a stake in the country's biggest mine (8).
