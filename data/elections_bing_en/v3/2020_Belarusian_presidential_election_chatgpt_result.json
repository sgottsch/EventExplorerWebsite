The election was also marred by allegations of interference from Russia and Poland (1). The international community had mixed reactions to the election (5). Lukashenko was ultimately inaugurated for his sixth term despite the protests (4). Other opposition candidates, such as Viktar Babaryka, were barred from running in the election (8,16). The protests were one of the largest challenges to Lukashenko's 26-year rule (12). The results of the election also sparked discussions between world leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin (18,20). Journalists who were detained while covering the election were also released (19)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2020/June/25", "Text": "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko accuses Russia and Poland of interfering in the upcoming presidential election.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2020/August/2", "Text": "Protests erupt in Minsk after the announcement of the 2020 Belarusian presidential election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2020/August/10", "Text": "Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a presidential candidate, flees to Lithuania amid protests and accusations of election fraud.", "Articles": ["3", "6"]}, {"Date": "2020/August/11", "Text": "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is inaugurated for his 6th term despite ongoing protests and international criticism.", "Articles": ["2", "5", "7"]}, {"Date": "2020/August/17", "Text": "The results of the 2020 Belarusian presidential election are disputed and trigger widespread protests.", "Articles": ["9", "10"]}, {"Date": "2020/August/18", "Text": "International reactions to the 2020 Belarusian presidential election are mixed.", "Articles": ["5", "8"]}, {"Date": "2020/September/6", "Text": "100,000 people march in Minsk to demand the resignation of President Lukashenko.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2020/September/23", "Text": "French President Emmanuel Macron concludes his visit to Latvia, where he discussed the situation in Belarus.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2020/September/30", "Text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss the situation in Belarus over the phone.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
