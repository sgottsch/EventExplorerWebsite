There were also discussions about compensation for the \"Soviet occupation\" period (13). The election was also mentioned in the context of gender equality, with UNDP publishing a thematic publication on gender key results (12)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/September/14", "Text": "The Central Election Commission officially publishes the lists of candidates for the upcoming Latvian parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["1", "6", "7"]}, {"Date": "2018/October/6", "Text": "The Latvian parliamentary election is held, with a turnout of 52.10% nationally.", "Articles": ["2", "3", "8", "11", "17"]}, {"Date": "2018/October/10", "Text": "The former coalition government loses almost half of its votes to new parties.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2018/October/14", "Text": "The Latvian government addresses a letter to voltairenet.org regarding an article about the new Iron Curtain.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2018/December/6", "Text": "The 6th Latvian MMA Championship takes place at the Latvian Top Fighters club.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2018/December/11", "Text": "The Latvian Bobsleigh Federation selects three athletes to compete in the women's bobsleigh discipline at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games.", "Articles": ["15"]}]}}}
