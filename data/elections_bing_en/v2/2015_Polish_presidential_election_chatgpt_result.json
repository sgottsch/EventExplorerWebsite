Duda's win was seen as a strong signal that electors were unhappy with the country's direction (7). The election result was also viewed as a huge blow to the ruling party Civic Platform (12). One of the main candidates, Janusz Palikot, admitted that his party was in a state of crisis (3). Other candidates in the election included rock star Pawel Kukiz (14), who suspended his campaign to visit his sick father (9), and former Prime Minister Leszek Miller (11). The election was ultimately won by Duda (10), and the incumbent Komorowski conceded defeat after an exit poll was released (12). The election also saw a significant rise in support for the conservative party Law and Justice (6). The election was viewed as a shift towards the political right in Poland (7). The incumbent Komorowski was an aristocrat who embodied Polish tradition (13). Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, the former Speaker of the Sejm (lower house of parliament), resigned from his position in the midst of the election (8, 15, 16, 19). Sikorski's party, Civic Platform, had governed Poland for eight years (6). One of the main issues in the election was the country's relationship with the European Union (7). The election also saw the registration of a new party, KORWiN (17), and the rise of a new political figure, Adam Jarubas (2). There were also concerns about terrorism during the election, with reports of a possible attack in Tunisia (20). Overall, the election was seen as a significant event in Polish politics, with a number of key players and issues at play (18)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2015/March/23", "Text": "40-year-old Adam Jarubas, the vice-leader of PSL party, is officially registered as a candidate for the Polish presidency.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2015/March/30", "Text": "Janusz Palikot, the leader of the Your Movement (Tw\u00f3j Ruch) party, expresses his party's struggle for survival in the current political climate.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2015/April/3", "Text": "Grzegorz Braun, a Polish politician, issues a statement outlining his political program, which includes the creation of a Catholic monarchy.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2015/April/25", "Text": "Janusz Korwin-Mikke, a member of the European Parliament, attends the Pyrkon 2015 convention in Pozna\u0144.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/13", "Text": "Andrzej Duda and Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski become the top two candidates in the Polish presidential election.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/17", "Text": "Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski, the incumbent, wins the presidential debate against Andrzej Duda.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/24", "Text": "Andrzej Duda, the frontrunner backed by the opposition, wins the Polish presidential election in a major upset.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/25", "Text": "Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski concedes defeat in the presidential election.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2015/June/2", "Text": "Andrzej Duda is announced as the winner of the Polish presidential election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2015/June/10", "Text": "Rados\u0142aw Sikorski resigns from his position as the Marshal of the Sejm.", "Articles": ["8", "15", "16", "19"]}, {"Date": "2015/June/11", "Text": "Rados\u0142aw Sikorski expresses his sadness and his party's struggle for survival during a television interview.", "Articles": ["3", "8", "14", "18", "20"]}, {"Date": "2015/June/23", "Text": "Rados\u0142aw Sikorski resigns from his position as the Marshal of the Sejm.", "Articles": ["8", "15", "16", "19"]}, {"Date": "2015/June/29", "Text": "Rados\u0142aw Sikorski speaks about the price of being in the public eye in relation to a recent terrorist attack in Tunisia.", "Articles": ["18", "20"]}]}}}
