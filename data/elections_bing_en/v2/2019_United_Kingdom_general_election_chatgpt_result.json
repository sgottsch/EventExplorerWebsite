This marked the biggest Conservative victory since 1987 (1). The election was largely centered around Brexit, with Johnson vowing to \"get Brexit done\" (6,7,8,11,14,20) and Corbyn promising to bring it to an end (11,14). Johnson's victory was seen as a rejection of Corbyn's leadership (11,16) and his \"comic indecision\" on Brexit (16). The election also saw the Labour Party lose seats (11,14,16), leading to Corbyn's resignation as leader (3,11,16). The Conservative Party's manifesto included a pledge to \"forge a new Britain\" (6) and a commitment to a net-zero carbon system by the 2030s (14).
