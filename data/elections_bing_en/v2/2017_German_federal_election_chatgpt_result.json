The far-right, anti-immigration party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), won seats in parliament for the first time (17). The election was held on September 24, 2017 (1,2,8,9,14,16,19,20) and the endg\u00fcltiges Ergebnis (final result) was announced on October 12, 2017 (12). The CDU/CSU won the highest percentage of the vote with 33% (4,6,7), but the SPD suffered a large swing against them of more than 8% (1). The Linke party, once mostly based in the east, was overtaken by the AfD (5). The Bundestag is made up of 709 seats (3,12). This election was significant for Israel, as the Federal Republic is one of its most important allies within the European Union (18)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/September/23", "Text": "Campaigning for the 2017 German federal election officially ends.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/24", "Text": "Angela Merkel wins her fourth term as chancellor of Germany, but the Social Democratic Party of Germany experiences its worst post-war election result.", "Articles": ["1", "2", "4", "9", "11", "12", "15", "16", "19"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/25", "Text": "The far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) gains seats in the German parliament for the first time.", "Articles": ["17", "18", "20"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/26", "Text": "The results of the 2017 German federal election are confirmed, with the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union winning the highest percentage of the vote.", "Articles": ["3", "8"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/27", "Text": "The Left party in Germany, which was once a dominant force in the East, sees a decline in support as the far-right AfD gains ground.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/28", "Text": "The German Centre Shanghai and the German Chamber of Foreign Trade hold a celebration for the 2017 federal election, featuring performances and a discussion on the results.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/12", "Text": "The final results of the 2017 German federal election are released, showing the number of seats each party will hold in the new parliament.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/17", "Text": "Euronews provides updates and information about the 2017 German federal election.", "Articles": ["11"]}]}}}
