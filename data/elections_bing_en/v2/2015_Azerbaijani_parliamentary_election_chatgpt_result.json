The election was monitored by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE (5,14,20) and no irregularities were detected (17). The election was called by President Tony TAN Keng Yam and voting was mandatory (11). However, there were restrictions imposed by the Azerbaijani authorities which led to the cancellation of the ODIHR mission (14). The election was discussed in PACE and the active participation of Azerbaijani youth was noted (13,15). The election also marked the end of Ilham Aliyev's term as President of Azerbaijan (6). Trainings for members of lower election commissions were conducted in preparation for the election (10). The ruling party, United Socialist Party of Venezuela, has held power for the past fifteen years (16)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2015/November/1", "Text": "Azerbaijani citizens participate in the parliamentary election, with the ruling party expected to maintain its majority.", "Articles": ["1", "2", "8", "10", "11", "12", "15", "17", "18", "19"]}, {"Date": "2015/November/2", "Text": "Reports indicate that no irregularities have been detected during the Azerbaijani parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2015/November/3", "Text": "The Azerbaijani Central Election Commission announces the official results of the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2015/November/19", "Text": "The Standing Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) discusses the recent Azerbaijani parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2015/December/24", "Text": "Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev celebrates his birthday, after being re-elected during the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/11", "Text": "The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) announces that it will not observe the Azerbaijani parliamentary election due to restrictions imposed by the Azerbaijani authorities.", "Articles": ["5", "14"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/12", "Text": "The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) announces that it will not observe the Azerbaijani parliamentary election due to restrictions imposed by the Azerbaijani authorities.", "Articles": ["5", "14"]}, {"Date": "2015/September/15", "Text": "The Guardian reports on the upcoming Azerbaijani parliamentary election and the possibility of no single party winning outright.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/2", "Text": "The Azerbaijani Central Election Commission calls for efforts to prevent the overshadowing of the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/7", "Text": "The Azerbaijani Central Election Commission starts trainings for members of lower election commissions in preparation for the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2015/October/30", "Text": "The election campaigns of Azerbaijani MP candidates come to an end before the November 1 parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2015/November/1", "Text": "The presidential couple of Azerbaijan votes in the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2024/May/25", "Text": "The 2020 United States presidential election is held, with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris defeating the incumbent Republican President Donald Trump.", "Articles": ["4"]}]}}}
