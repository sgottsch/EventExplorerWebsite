The election was held on March 23 (14) and a second round was held on April 6 (4). Slovakia has a history of snap elections, with the most recent being in September 2023 (15). Pellegrini's win was a surprise to many (4,19) and came after a year of political turmoil and the resignation of the previous president (16,17). Pellegrini plans to run as a pro-Western liberal opponent (11) in a country that has leaned more towards the EU in recent years (8). The election has also brought attention to other elections in Europe, such as the 2023 Spanish general election (5) and the June 2023 Greek legislative election (6,7), as well as the 2023 Thai general election (9). Pellegrini's win marks a continuation of the country's current economic policies (16,20)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2023/12/31", "Text": "A billboard promoting the opposition-initiated referendum on a snap election is put up in Slovakia.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/4", "Text": "Zuzana Caputova announces she will not seek re-election in the upcoming presidential election in Slovakia.", "Articles": ["16", "20"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/8", "Text": "Slovak parliament speaker Peter Pellegrini announces the date of the presidential election and his own candidacy.", "Articles": ["2", "11"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/9", "Text": "Parliament Speaker Peter Pellegrini sets the date for the presidential election in Slovakia.", "Articles": ["14", "17"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/19", "Text": "Peter Pellegrini confirms his candidacy for the presidential election.", "Articles": ["1", "18"]}, {"Date": "2024/1/20", "Text": "Peter Pellegrini's presidential campaign officially begins.", "Articles": ["1", "18"]}, {"Date": "2024/2/15", "Text": "Slovakia's language links are moved to the top of the page.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2024/4/6", "Text": "Peter Pellegrini wins the presidential election in Slovakia.", "Articles": ["4", "19"]}, {"Date": "2024/4/8", "Text": "Robert Fico becomes Prime Minister of Slovakia again after the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2024/5/4", "Text": "Slovakia prepares for an election that could change its relationship with the EU and Russia.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2024/5/22", "Text": "The first round of the Greek legislative election is held.", "Articles": ["6", "7"]}, {"Date": "2024/5/25", "Text": "Thailand holds general elections.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2024/5/26", "Text": "Spain holds a general election.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2024/6/3", "Text": "The presidential election in Slovakia is held.", "Articles": ["1", "2", "3"]}]}}}
