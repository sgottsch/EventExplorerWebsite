Putin's decision to run for a fifth term has been seen as a move to extend his rule and maintain his grip on power in Russia (6,8,13,16)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2024/March/14", "Text": "Three-day presidential election begins in Russia.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2024/March/15", "Text": "Vladimir Putin votes online in the presidential election at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2024/March/17", "Text": "President Vladimir Putin is declared the winner of the 2024 Russian presidential election.", "Articles": ["2", "5", "11", "19"]}, {"Date": "2023/December/8", "Text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin announces his intention to run in the 2024 presidential election.", "Articles": ["7", "16"]}, {"Date": "2023/December/7", "Text": "The date of the 2024 Russian presidential election is set for March 17.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2024/January/2", "Text": "Russian democracy regresses as Putin decides that term limits do not apply in the 2024 presidential election.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2024/January/4", "Text": "Putin will use the election to show a war-weary Russia that he is still in control.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2023/November/20", "Text": "Secretary of Ukraine's national security announces that Russia could begin a full mobilization after the 2024 presidential election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2024/February/8", "Text": "Russian authorities ban the only openly oppositional candidate from the presidential race.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2024/February/25", "Text": "Early voting in the Russian presidential election commences in remote regions.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2024/March/10", "Text": "The license to share, copy, distribute, and transmit the work is granted for the picture of the 2024 Russian presidential election.", "Articles": ["9"]}]}}}
