This was a significant event in the country's political landscape (1,2,4,6). The election was held by the country's parliament (1,2,4,6). This was not the only important presidential election in 2022, as the Philippines also held a presidential election (5,9,13,14,15,16,19,20). In this election, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. appeared to have won by a landslide, sparking controversy due to his family's history and allegations of cheating (9,13,14,15,16). Other notable presidential elections in 2022 included those in Iraq, Turkey, and Serbia (10,11,12,18). However, the Iraqi election was largely ceremonial as the country operates under a parliamentary system (10). In addition to national presidential elections, there were also elections for the vice-president of India (8) and the IDF Chief of the General Staff in Israel (3). Overall, 2022 was a significant year for presidential elections around the world, with notable changes in leadership and political controversy."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/June/4", "Text": "Bajram Begaj, chief of staff of the Albanian Armed Forces, is elected president by the Parliament in Tirana, Albania.", "Articles": ["1", "4"]}, {"Date": "2022/June/5", "Text": "Eligibility for the Indian presidential election is discussed.", "Articles": ["5", "8"]}, {"Date": "2022/June/6", "Text": "The Israeli Defense Forces appoint Major General Herzi Halevi as the 23rd Chief of the General Staff.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2022/July/9", "Text": "Goodluck Jonathan becomes the President of Nigeria after the death of Umaru Yar'Adua.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2022/August/6", "Text": "Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is elected as the next President of the Philippines.", "Articles": ["13", "14", "16"]}, {"Date": "2022/September/4", "Text": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is re-elected.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/13", "Text": "The Iraqi presidential election is held, with Barham Salih beaten by Abdul Latif Rashid.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/19", "Text": "Colombia's presidential election goes to a runoff.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/27", "Text": "The Constitutional Council of France proclaims Emmanuel Macron as the President of France.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2023/May/23", "Text": "Turkey holds both presidential and parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["18"]}]}}}
