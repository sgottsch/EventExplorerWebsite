This decision was made despite May previously ruling out an early election (9). The election was triggered by May's announcement to resign as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister (2). The results were declared on June 9, with Jeremy Corbyn challenging May for the prime ministerial chair (1,3). May made the announcement with reluctance, stating that it was in the country's best interests to have a strong and elected leader (5,6). However, the election resulted in a humiliating setback for May as she lost her overall majority in Parliament to Corbyn's Labour Party (7).
