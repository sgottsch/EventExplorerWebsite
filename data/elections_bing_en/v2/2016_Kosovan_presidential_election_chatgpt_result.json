The election was contested by the opposition (2, 4, 8, 13, 19) and sparked violent protests (4, 5, 19). Thaci's victory was met with celebrations by his supporters (9). The election was part of a larger trend in presidential elections in 2016, including those in Uganda (10, 16), the United States (7), Zambia (6), and Taiwan (20). The new President's past involvement with organized crime was also brought to light (12). The election was seen as a test for national unity in the young country (11)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2016/February/17", "Text": "Thousands of protesters in Kosovo demand new leadership on the country's eighth independence day.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2016/January/4", "Text": "Zambia sets presidential election to take place in August 2016.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2016/January/16", "Text": "Tsai Ing-wen becomes the first woman to be elected president of Taiwan.", "Articles": ["20"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/20", "Text": "Yoweri Museveni is declared the winner of Uganda's presidential election.", "Articles": ["10", "16"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/26", "Text": "Hashim Thaci is elected as the new president of Kosovo.", "Articles": ["1", "3", "4", "5", "8", "9", "11", "17", "18"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/27", "Text": "National unity in Kosovo is questioned as Hashim Thaci ascends to the country's highest office.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2016/April/1", "Text": "A leaked BND dossier on Hashim Thaci reports his involvement in criminal activities.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2016/April/10", "Text": "The 2016 presidential election in Comoros is held, with candidates from Grand Comore Island.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/27", "Text": "The 2016 FIFA presidential election is held, with consensus on notability but inability to post due to state of articles.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2024/May/26", "Text": "The 2016 United States presidential election takes place, with all 50 states and the District of Columbia participating.", "Articles": ["7"]}]}}}
