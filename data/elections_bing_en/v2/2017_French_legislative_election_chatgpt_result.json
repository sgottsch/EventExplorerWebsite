President Emmanuel Macron's party appeared to have a strong chance of gaining a commanding majority in the first round of parliamentary elections (5). Macron's political movement unveiled a list of 428 candidates, including an eclectic mix of individuals from various backgrounds (3). The old model of French politics was shattered by the first-round result (8). The Socialists, who won a majority in 2012, only fielded 414 candidates this time and garnered only 7% of the vote (4). The first round of elections took place on June 11, 2017 (1,5). A special issue of French Politics was dedicated to the 2017 Presidential and Legislative Elections in France (6). Jean Lassalle, a surprise candidate, claimed to be the defender of rural France (9).
