Interior Minister Kajsa Ollongren proposed spreading the election over three days due to the COVID-19 pandemic (1). Ollongren was also chosen, along with Annemarie Jorritsma, to lead the initial coalition talks (2). Ollongren tested positive for COVID-19 and resigned from her position (3). She was later appointed as the new director of the Belastingdienst (4). Ollongren is married to TV-producer Irene van den Brekel and has two sons (3). She is also a fan of cycling and running (3). In April 2021, Ollongren was unable to remember a conversation about Pieter Omtzigt, which led to her resignation (6). She also gave a speech about disinformation as a threat to the rule of law (7). Ollongren tested negative for COVID-19 and was able to attend a debate about the failed first coalition talks (8). She was also given the responsibility of making the notulen of the toeslagenaffaire public (9).
