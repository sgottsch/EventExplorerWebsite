He defeated incumbent conservative Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic in a run-off election (2). The function of the Croatian president is largely ceremonial, with a formal role in foreign policy (3). In the first round of the election, there was no televised debate of all presidential candidates (4). The first round of the election was held on December 22, 2019, with a second round or runoff on January 5, 2020 (5,6). Milanovic is the only politician to be elected to two of the most important state functions, first as prime minister and now president (7). Miroslav Skoro, who came in third in the first round, voted in the runoff but did not vote for either of the two candidates, instead adding his own candidate on the ballot (8). The presidential election was held on December 22, 2019 (9).
