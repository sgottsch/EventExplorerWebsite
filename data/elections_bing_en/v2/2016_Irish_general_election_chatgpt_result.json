The Social Democrats party (1,4,5,7,10) formed in 2015 (7) was one of the new political parties that emerged and gained support (7). The party was founded by three independent MPs Stephen Donnelly, Catherine Murphy and Roisin Shortall (7). Donnelly was elected in the Wicklow constituency (4) and received 14,348 votes (4). The Social Democrats hoped to become a serious force in Irish politics (5). Opinion polls leading up to the election were taken to gauge support for political parties (6,10). The ruling party, Fine Gael, won the most seats (8) with 25.52% of the vote (8). However, their government partner, Labour, only won 6.9% of the vote (8). The general election was seen as a chance for change (9), with voters searching for alternative options (7)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2016/February/3", "Text": "The 2016 Irish general election is announced.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/6", "Text": "Opinion polls are conducted in preparation for the Irish general election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/10", "Text": "Queries about the upcoming Irish general election include questions about who to vote for and who will win.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/16", "Text": "New political parties, such as the Social Democrats, gain popularity in the lead up to the Irish general election.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/26", "Text": "Youthful candidates hope to attract votes from the internet generation and those affected by the recession.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/27", "Text": "The results of the 2016 Irish general election are announced, with a focus on the success of the Social Democrats.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2016/February/29", "Text": "The Irish Cabinet meets to discuss the results of the general election, including the strong showing of the Social Democrats.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2016/March/1", "Text": "Fine Gael, the party of outgoing Taoiseach Enda Kenny, wins the most seats in the general election.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2016/March/9", "Text": "The surprising results of the 2016 Irish general election highlight the importance of local politics.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2024/May/25", "Text": "The 2020 Irish general election is held, with similar dynamics and parties as the 2016 election.", "Articles": ["2"]}]}, "People Before Profit\u2013Solidarity": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["2020 Irish general election - Wikipedia - Al-Quds University", "Opinion polling for the 2016 Irish general election - Wikipedia", "2020 Irish general election - Wikipedia", "General Election 2016: Fianna Fail to re-introduce water ... - Irish Mirror", "General Elections 2016 Ireland - robert-schuman.eu", "Election 2016 count: Results and main points from across the ...", "General Election results 2016 recap: Cabinet to meet ... - Irish Mirror", "IFES Election Guide | Elections: Ireland House of Representatives 2016", "2020 Irish general election - atozwiki.com", "General Election 2016: Race to form new government after ... - Irish Mirror", "General Election 2016: Fine Gael will shovel \u20ac300 ... - Irish Mirror", "Election 2016 Results: Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il ... - The Irish Times", "Administrative Panel #seanad16 - Irish Election Literature", "General Election 2016: Red C poll predicts hung Dail to ... - Irish Mirror", "2020 Irish general election - Wikipedia - en.turkcewiki.org", "2020 Irish general election - Wikipedia - acceptablelobster.com", "General Election 2016: Hung Dail could be outcome of ... - Irish Mirror", "12 page leaflet in pdf format from William DJ Gorman \u2013 Dublin Central # ...", "Index of 2016 Seanad Leaflets | Irish Election Literature", "Eamonn McCann | Irish Election Literature"], "1": {"Title": "2020 Irish general election - Wikipedia - Al-Quds University", "Snippet": "The 2020 Irish general election took place on Saturday 8 February, ...
