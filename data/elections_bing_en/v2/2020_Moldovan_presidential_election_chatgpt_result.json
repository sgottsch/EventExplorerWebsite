This election was the fourth direct presidential election since Moldova's independence in 1991 (5). The date of the election was set by Parliament on May 21 (5). The election was seen as a blow to the Kremlin, as Sandu is pro-EU and defeated pro-Russian incumbent Igor Dodon (9, 10). This election was also notable for being very close, with just 70,000 votes separating the candidates in 2016 and potentially being even closer in 2020 (4). Russian commentators debated the outcome of the election, with President Vladimir Putin previously endorsing Dodon (6).
