If no candidate had received this majority, a third round would have been held (2). This election was the second since the conflict began in 2011 (3). The results were announced by the Electoral College, which includes members of Parliament and representatives from municipalities (4). This election was held using a mixed-member proportional representation system (5). In other countries, such as Peru and Zambia, recent elections have also resulted in new presidents (6,7,9). The local elections in Estonia in 2021 also saw the Center Party lose its absolute majority for the first time in 15 years (8).

The upcoming local elections in Estonia are expected to be fractured, with campaigns addressing everyday concerns (5,6). In South Korea, the ruling liberal party has nominated a maverick politician as its candidate for the 2022 presidential election (7). The general election in Malta will take place in 2022 (8). The OSCE has deployed an Election Observation Mission to the presidential election in Uzbekistan on October 24, 2021 (9).
