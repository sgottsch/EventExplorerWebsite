The election saw a decrease in support for the ruling party GERB, largely due to anti-corruption protests (1). However, in a run-off of the presidential election, incumbent President Rumen Radev won a second term on an anti-corruption platform (3). Despite this, the failure of three parties to form a government resulted in a double election in November (6). The final voter turnout for the November elections was low (7). The election was announced in September by the Bulgarian president, after the previous polls failed to form a government (8). A poll conducted in November showed that Boiko Borissov's GERB-UDF coalition was set for the largest share of the vote (9). A mod was created in November to simulate the election and its potential outcomes (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2021/July/11", "Text": "The Bulgarian parliamentary election takes place, with the ITN party winning the largest share of the vote.", "Articles": ["2", "6"]}, {"Date": "2021/September/16", "Text": "The Bulgarian president announces early parliamentary elections for November 14 due to the failure to form a government.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2021/October/22", "Text": "Anti-corruption protests erupt in Bulgaria, contributing to the decline in support for the ruling GERB party.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2021/October/25", "Text": "Guidelines for the upcoming Bulgarian parliamentary election are released.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2021/November/5", "Text": "The Bulgarian parliamentary election mod is announced, featuring 6 main competing parties.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2021/November/12", "Text": "A poll shows the GERB-UDF coalition leading in the upcoming parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2021/November/14", "Text": "The Bulgarian parliamentary election takes place, with low voter turnout.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2021/November/21", "Text": "Rumen Radev is re-elected as President of Bulgaria on an anti-corruption platform.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/4", "Text": "The final registers of electors are released for the geographical and functional constituencies.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/19", "Text": "The Bulgarian parliamentary election takes place, with the ITN party winning the largest share of the vote.", "Articles": ["2", "6"]}]}, "Petkov Government": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["General Elections 2021 Bulgaria - robert-schuman.eu", "Bulgaria\u2019s Petkov coalition government: meet the ministers", "2021 Bulgarian general election - a not-so-short guide", "Bulgaria\u2019s parliament endorses government led by Kiril Petkov", "Bulgaria\u2019s Parliament votes Petkov coalition government into office", "Prime Minister Petkov presents plans of new Bulgarian government in ...", "Harvard-educated Petkov elected as Bulgaria\u2019s prime minister", "Presidential Election 2021 Bulgaria - robert-schuman.eu", "Who won the Bulgarian parliamentary elections? - The Washington Post", "Kiril Petkov is the big winner of the night in Bulgarian election", "A reformist prime minister takes over in Bulgaria - The Economist", "Bulgarian Election Winner Kiril Petkov: \"We Will Be Merciless in ...", "Presidential Election 2021 Bulgaria - robert-schuman.eu", "NATO Secretary General with the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril ...", "Bulgaria\u2019s Election Victor Successfully Closes Coalition Talks", "Bulgaria: Centrist party leader to form government \u2013 DW \u2013 12/11/2021", "Bulgaria to hold early general elections on Nov. 14 | Europe - Yeni \u015eafak", "The New Cabinet: Bulgaria Finally has a New Government", "Bulgaria\u2019s centrist PP party seals deal for coalition government", "Bulgarian election: Kiril Petkov, Assen Vassilev, a battle-bus and a ..."], "1": {"Title": "General Elections 2021 Bulgaria - robert-schuman.eu", "Snippet": "The new element in the third parliamentary election is the emergence of a new movement, Let's Pursue Change, created by Kiril Petkov, Minister of Economy, and Asen Vassilev, Minister of Finance of the expert government led by outgoing Prime Minister Yanev Stefan.
