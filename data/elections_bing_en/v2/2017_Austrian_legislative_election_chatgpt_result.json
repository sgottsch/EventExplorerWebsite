The leader of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO), Heinz-Christian Strache, dismissed his neo-Nazi past as \"naivete\" (1). The FPO is a far-right party that is now on course to enter the government for the first time (6). The FPO is also known for its stance that Islam is incompatible with democracy (7). Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, of the center-left Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPO), ruled out joining a coalition government if his party loses the election (8).
