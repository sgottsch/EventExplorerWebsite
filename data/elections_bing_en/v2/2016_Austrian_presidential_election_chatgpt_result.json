The original election results were annulled and a re-vote took place on December 4 (4). The election was contested by six candidates, including independent candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, who was ultimately sworn in as president on January 26, 2017 (3,5). The far-right candidate, Norbert Hofer, lost by a narrow margin and his party launched a challenge of the result (2). The Constitutional Court ordered a rerun of the election (1) and it was later confirmed that Van der Bellen won with 50% of the vote (3). Richard Lugner, who ran as an independent candidate, also participated in the election and received support from 6,000 people (20). The election was seen as a test of the relative standing of each of the main parties (17,18)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2016/03/24", "Text": "Andreas Khol, the candidate for the Austrian People's Party, announces his candidacy for the presidential election.", "Articles": ["12", "13"]}, {"Date": "2016/04/24", "Text": "The first round of the presidential election takes place, with six candidates competing.", "Articles": ["4", "5", "8"]}, {"Date": "2016/04/25", "Text": "Independent candidate Alexander Van der Bellen is declared the winner of the presidential election in Vienna.", "Articles": ["3", "6"]}, {"Date": "2016/05/04", "Text": "Andreas Khol, candidate for the Austrian People's Party, concedes defeat in the presidential election.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2016/05/08", "Text": "Independent candidate Alexander Van der Bellen is sworn in as the twelfth president of Austria.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2016/06/08", "Text": "The Austrian Freedom Party challenges the result of the presidential election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2016/06/20", "Text": "Witnesses testify in Vienna on alleged voting irregularities in the presidential election.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2016/07/01", "Text": "Austrian court orders a presidential election rerun after the Freedom Party's challenge.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2016/07/06", "Text": "The Austrian People's Party candidate, Andreas Khol, is profiled as he campaigns for the presidential election.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2016/07/24", "Text": "Richard Lugner announces his candidacy for the presidential election.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2016/07/30", "Text": "Richard Lugner begins his presidential campaign in Salzburg.", "Articles": ["15", "16"]}, {"Date": "2016/08/30", "Text": "Richard Lugner, a former presidential candidate, is interviewed about his current presidential campaign.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
