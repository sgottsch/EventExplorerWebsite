The election was held on April 4, 2021 (1, 4, 7, 10) and was the second attempt at electing a president after the first attempt failed (1, 4). The event drew attention due to efforts by former president Donald Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the United States (2). This was the fourth local election since Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008 (3). The Kosovo Central Election Commission verified the participation of 90 political subjects (3).

It was also seen as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic (3). The election was marred by election fraud in some areas, resulting in a second ballot being held in October/November 2021 (1)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2021/February/14", "Text": "Kosovo's leftist Vetevendosje party wins the parliamentary election, with Albin Kurti as the likely new prime minister.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2021/March/22", "Text": "Glauk Konjufca is elected as the new Speaker of the Assembly, taking over as acting president until May 5.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2021/April/4", "Text": "Vjosa Osmani, a U.S.-educated law professor and Vetevendosje candidate, is appointed as Kosovo's new president.", "Articles": ["4", "7", "8"]}, {"Date": "2021/October/17", "Text": "Local elections are held in Kosovo, with 17 municipalities electing mayors in the first round and 21 more to vote in November.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2021/October/25", "Text": "The Supreme Court annuls a decision for a re-vote in Hani i Elezit due to election fraud.", "Articles": ["1"]}]}, "Vjosa Osmani": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Kosovo: Wer ist die neue Pr\u00e4sidentin Vjosa Osmani?", "Vjosa Osmani: Politikane me parime dhe q\u00eb guxon t\u00eb rrezikoj\u00eb", "Kosovo\u2019s parliament elects Vjosa Osmani as president\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff", "Vjosa Osmani: La presidenta que encarna el cambio en Kosovo ...", "Kosovo Parliament Elects Vjosa Osmani as National President", "Offizieller Besuch der Pr\u00e4sidentin der Republik Kosovo, Vjosa Osmani ...", "Vjosa Osmani: Moja dnevnica u Albaniji je iznosila 39 evra", "Kosovo: Vjosa Osmani eletta presidente del Kosovo", "KO JE ZAPRAVO VJOSA OSMANI?
