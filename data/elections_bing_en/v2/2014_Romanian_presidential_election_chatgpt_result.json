Among them were Victor Ponta and Klaus Iohannis, who won the first round and was eventually sworn into office on December 21 (1,3,5,7). Iohannis, who is of German descent, was also the first president from a minority population in Romania (5). The election was seen as an opportunity to crack down on corruption, a long-standing issue in Romania (3). Ponta, who had been accused of plagiarism, eventually conceded to Iohannis (6,9).

The election was held in two rounds on November 16 and December 12, 2004 (12). Iohannis won the election with 54.43% of the vote (3). The election was seen as a significant moment in the country's democratic history (10). The previous president, Traian B\u0103sescu, had been in office since 2004 and was known for his anti-corruption stance (2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20). Iohannis promised to continue fighting corruption and strengthening institutions during his time in office (2). The election also highlighted the importance of the German minority population in Romania, as Iohannis is of German descent (18). The election was overshadowed by concerns about voter turnout and the role of expatriate voters (8)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2014/11/2", "Text": "Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta is set to win the first round of the country's presidential election.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2014/11/16", "Text": "Klaus Iohannis wins Romania's presidential election, beating Prime Minister Victor Ponta in the second round of voting.", "Articles": ["3", "4"]}, {"Date": "2014/12/3", "Text": "Romania's groundbreaking presidential election marks a significant moment in democratic history.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2014/12/21", "Text": "Klaus Iohannis is sworn in as Romania's new president.", "Articles": ["2", "11", "18"]}, {"Date": "2014/9/8", "Text": "Traian Basescu wins the election for president of Romania.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2014/10/3", "Text": "Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta explains why he would make a good President as the country prepares for elections.", "Articles": ["5", "6", "15", "16"]}, {"Date": "2014/10/30", "Text": "President Traian Basescu announces that after the Moldovan parliamentary elections, he will request Moldovan citizenship.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2014/11/12", "Text": "Prime Minister Victor Ponta launches his campaign for the presidency, promising a more united country.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2014/12/1", "Text": "President Traian Basescu declares that Romanians have shown a stronger will than politicians and television networks.", "Articles": ["13", "19"]}, {"Date": "2014/9/5", "Text": "President Traian Basescu emphasizes that freedom is not free and that Romania will host a NATO command center.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
