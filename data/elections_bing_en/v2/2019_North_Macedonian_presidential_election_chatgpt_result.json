Siljanovska-Davkova is a law professor and was supported by her party as an independent thinker (2). The election was closely contested, with Siljanovska receiving the largest share of the vote in the first round but not meeting the threshold to win (7). In the second round, Pendarovski narrowly won with 44% of the vote (8). The election was seen as a test for North Macedonia's progress towards integration with NATO and the EU (5). However, there were concerns about voter turnout and the validity of the election (9). In a separate development, former spy chief Saso Mijalkov, who was a key figure in the VMRO DPMNE party, was jailed for election fraud (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2019/February/27", "Text": "Gordana Siljanovska is nominated by the opposition VMRO DPMNE party for the North Macedonian presidential election.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2019/March/3", "Text": "The ruling coalition nominates Stevo Pendarovski as their candidate for the North Macedonian presidential election.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2019/April/21", "Text": "The first round of the North Macedonian presidential election is held, with Stevo Pendarovski and Gordana Siljanovska receiving the most votes.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/5", "Text": "The second round of the North Macedonian presidential election takes place, with candidates Stevo Pendarovski and Gordana Siljanovska in a near dead heat.", "Articles": ["1", "3", "4", "9"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/12", "Text": "In the second round of the North Macedonian presidential election, Stevo Pendarovski defeats Gordana Siljanovska.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2019/May/14", "Text": "The outcome and consequences of the North Macedonian presidential election are discussed, with Stevo Pendarovski declared the winner.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2019/March/8", "Text": "Former spy chief Saso Mijalkov is jailed for election fraud in the 2014 North Macedonian presidential election.", "Articles": ["10"]}]}, "Event": {}, "Global_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["2019 North Macedonia presidential election : r/neoliberal -
