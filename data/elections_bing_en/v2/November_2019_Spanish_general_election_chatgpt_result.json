If endorsed by parliament, it would be Spain's first coalition government since the re-establishment of democracy in 1977 (14). The election also saw the rise of the far-right party Vox, becoming the third political force in Spain (5). This coalition government was formed after the previous election in April 2019 also resulted in a political deadlock (19).
