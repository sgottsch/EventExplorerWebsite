The election was also seen as undemocratic due to the exclusion of Georgian parties (5). The closure of a Soviet-built hydroelectric plant on the de facto border of Georgia and Abkhazia highlighted the issue of efficiency (7). The European Parliament condemned the developments in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali, where illegal elections were held (8). Direct elections to the European Parliament are held every five years (9).
