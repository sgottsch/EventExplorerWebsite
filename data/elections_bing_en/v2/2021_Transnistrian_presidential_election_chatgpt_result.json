The election had two candidates, incumbent president Vadim Krasnoselsky and Sergey Pynzar, with Krasnoselsky ultimately winning with almost 80% of the ballots (20). The election was considered illegal by Moldova and its Foreign Affairs Ministry did not recognize its legitimacy (4). The elections sparked discussions about the region's ties to the former Soviet Union (8,17,19) and the impact of the Gagauz democracy on the region's decision to rejoin Moldova in 1994 (18). Some also called into question the legitimacy of the election due to the dominance of the \"Sheriff\" conglomerate in the region (11,16). The election was also mentioned in relation to other presidential elections, such as the 2023 election (13) and the 2024 Salvadoran election (5)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2021/November/8", "Text": "Nicaragua holds presidential election amidst political crackdown by the Ortega regime.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2021/November/14", "Text": "Incumbent President Rumen Radev wins the first round of the Bulgarian presidential election with a 22.6 percentage point lead over his closest rival.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2021/November/19", "Text": "Moldovan President Maia Sandu declares the upcoming Transnistrian presidential election illegal.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2021/November/22", "Text": "Bulgarian President Rumen Radev is re-elected for a second term with a wide margin, solidifying gains made by anti-corruption forces in the country.", "Articles": ["3", "10"]}, {"Date": "2021/November/26", "Text": "Romania and Moldova celebrate the first anniversary of Maia Sandu's victory in the Moldovan presidential election.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/1", "Text": "The head of a telecom company based in the separatist region of Transnistria is arrested in Bulgaria for alleged involvement in money laundering.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/6", "Text": "Early voting for the Transnistrian presidential election begins, with two candidates competing for the position.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/8", "Text": "The Transnistrian Central Electoral Commission cancels a lottery to distribute free airtime among presidential candidates due to only one candidate being registered.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/10", "Text": "The executive director of Promo-Lex Association and a political commentator describe the Transnistrian presidential election as an illegal exercise with a predictable outcome.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/11", "Text": "Transnistria prepares to hold presidential election with only one candidate, incumbent leader Vadim Krasnoselsky.", "Articles": ["13", "17"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/12", "Text": "Transnistria holds presidential election with only one candidate, incumbent leader Vadim Krasnoselsky.", "Articles": ["1", "12", "15", "18"]}, {"Date": "2021/December/13", "Text": "Preliminary results for the Transnistrian presidential election show incumbent leader Vadim Krasnoselsky winning by a landslide.", "Articles": ["20"]}]}}}
