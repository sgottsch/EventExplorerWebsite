In the first round of the election, none of the nine candidates won a majority (5). Gitanas Nauseda, an economist, won the election with 66.72% of the vote (6). Banker-turned-politician Gitanas Nauseda won the presidential runoff election after his opponent Ingrida Simonyte conceded (7). The ruling party's leader stated that the party may quit power if it loses the presidential and European Parliament elections (8). In the first round of the election, Ingrida Simonyte was in the lead by 3,935 votes (9).
