The election was preceded by the 2022 French presidential election in which Macron secured a second term (2). The French executive's agenda was affected by the upcoming legislative elections, with 15 members of the government running as candidates (3). The electoral campaign saw a resurgent and unified left as the main opposition (6). The far-right party, Rassemblement national, reached a historic score of 90 seats (10). The election also saw the defeat of Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, France's minister for ecological transition (4)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/June/12", "Text": "The first round of the 2022 French legislative election takes place, with results showing a potential reshaping of the French National Assembly.", "Articles": ["2", "3", "4", "7"]}, {"Date": "2022/June/19", "Text": "The second round of the 2022 French legislative election takes place, with results showing a potential reshaping of the French National Assembly.", "Articles": ["1", "5", "9", "10"]}, {"Date": "2022/June/20", "Text": "The final results of the 2022 French legislative election are announced, with the Rassemblement National achieving a historic number of seats in the National Assembly.", "Articles": ["5", "6", "9", "10"]}, {"Date": "2022/July/7", "Text": "The re-parliamentarization of French politics is discussed following the unprecedented results of the 2022 French legislative election.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2022/June/27", "Text": "A flash report is released on the results of the 2022 French legislative election, noting the high level of abstention and the potential impact on government.", "Articles": ["9"]}]}, "Richard Ferrand": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["L\u00e9gislatives 2022.

This victory was followed by the French legislative election, where Macron's centrist alliance Ensemble gained 89 seats (2). However, the far-right also saw success in the election, with the National Unity Party (NUPES) gaining 142 seats (9). This surge in far-right support was seen as a shock to France's political order (18), with the left-wing alliance facing an \"anti-M\u00e9lenchon\" front (20). The election also saw the first woman, Yael Braun-Pivet, elected as speaker of the National Assembly (8).
