The election was between the incumbent Labour Party and the Nationalist Party, who formed a coalition with the newly formed Democratic Party to create Forza Nazzjonali (12, 16). Labour Party leader Joseph Muscat was projected to win with 54.9% of the popular vote (7, 9). The coalition's electoral manifesto included proposals for the economy and financial regulation (14, 17). There were also concerns about potential interference from Russia in the election (19). Overall, the election was seen as a close race between the two major parties (15, 20)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/June/1", "Text": "The Maltese general election is announced to be held on June 3rd.", "Articles": ["1", "2"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/4", "Text": "The Maltese general election is won by the Labour Party, led by Joseph Muscat, with Forza Nazzjonali conceding defeat.", "Articles": ["3", "4", "5"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/6", "Text": "Simon Busuttil officially concedes defeat to Joseph Muscat and his Labour Party.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/14", "Text": "Casual elections are announced to take place on June 20th.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/24", "Text": "The PN and the PD sign a coalition agreement.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/29", "Text": "Simon Busuttil claims that the Forza Nazzjonali manifesto would lead to a 14% deficit.", "Articles": ["13"]}]}}}
