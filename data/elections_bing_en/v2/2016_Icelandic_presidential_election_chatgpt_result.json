He has also inspired a technology giant with his ideas on energy usage in Reykjavik (8). In an opinion poll, Magnason is shown to have the most support along with three other candidates (9). The presidential election in Iceland is seen as a battle between old debates and looking ahead (5). Magnason has also written books about Iceland's highlands and the country's energy usage (3).
