The results were considered a shock (10) and were seen as a victory for the liberal party (3,6). However, the election also saw a rise in voter turnout (6) and a cementing of the position of the far-right party in Italy (5). The electoral campaign mainly focused on domestic concerns (9) and the aftermath of the European Parliament election (7).
