Mattarella, a constitutional court judge, entered politics in 1983 after his brother was murdered by the Mafia (4). The previous record for the longest presidential election was in 1962 (2). The incumbent president, Giorgio Napolitano, resigned at the age of 89 (9). The candidate of the anti-establishment Movimento 5 Stelle party, Ferdinando Imposimato, came in second in the election (4). The process of selecting a new president began on January 29, 2015 (11,15). A 2/3 majority of grand electors (672 votes) was needed for the first three rounds of voting, but a simple majority (505 votes) was enough for the fourth round (17,18)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2015/January/31", "Text": "Sergio Mattarella is elected as Italy's new president in the fourth round of balloting by the Italian parliament.", "Articles": ["1", "3", "6", "12", "16", "17", "18", "20"]}, {"Date": "2015/February/1", "Text": "Sergio Mattarella is officially sworn in as Italy's 12th president.", "Articles": ["4", "8"]}, {"Date": "2015/February/3", "Text": "The 2015 Italian presidential election is seen as a success for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.", "Articles": ["16", "17", "18"]}, {"Date": "2015/March/10", "Text": "The result of the 1920 presidential election in the United States is discussed.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2015/April/29", "Text": "Italian lawmakers fail to elect a new president in the first round of voting.", "Articles": ["7", "10", "15"]}, {"Date": "2015/May/23", "Text": "The 2018 Russian presidential election is discussed.", "Articles": ["14", "19"]}]}}}
