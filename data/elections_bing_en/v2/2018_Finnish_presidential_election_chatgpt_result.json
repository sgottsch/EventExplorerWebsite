He received 72% of the vote in the first round, avoiding a runoff (2). His closest opponent, Merja Kyll\u00f6nen, represented the leftist party (9). The election had a high voter turnout, with the archetypal voter being a 55-69 year old male (8). Niinisto's victory was seen as a landslide (7). The election was also significant for the fact that it was the first time since 1994 that an incumbent president was re-elected (5). Some candidates in the election included Pekka Haavisto of the Green Party (3), Matti Vanhanen of the Centrist Party (4), and Laura Huhtasaari of the True Finns party (5).
