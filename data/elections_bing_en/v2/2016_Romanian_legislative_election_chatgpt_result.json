The PSD, along with the National Liberal Party (PNL) and a Hungarian minority party, will form the coalition government (7). The new Prime Minister, Sorin Grindeanu, was appointed by President Klaus Iohannis (10). Over 7 million Romanians voted in the election (9). The electoral law was modified in July 2015, resulting in a lower chamber with 308 members (1). The PSD's victory marks their return to power after a corruption scandal forced their previous prime minister out (3,5). The PNL had set a goal to win a quarter of the seats in the Chamber (6).
