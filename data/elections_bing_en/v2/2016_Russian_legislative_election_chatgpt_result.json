The opposition parties, including the Communist Party and nationalist LDPR, each secured about 13% of the vote (9). There were concerns about fraud in the election, with low turnout and statistics pointing to possible manipulation (2, 6, 8). This election was seen as a threat to Putin's power, but the results solidified his control (3). The turnout for the election was a record high (2, 5) and is considered one of the most important polls in Russia since 2014 (2). This election was also compared to the 2016 Moroccan parliamentary election, where the Islamic PJD party won (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2016/September/16", "Text": "Russian opposition parties prepare for parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2016/September/18", "Text": "Election day for the Russian legislative election.", "Articles": ["4", "5"]}, {"Date": "2016/September/19", "Text": "Vladimir Putin's party, United Russia, wins a majority in the parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["1", "7", "9"]}, {"Date": "2016/September/20", "Text": "Reports indicate possible fraud in the Russian legislative election.", "Articles": ["6", "8"]}]}, "Russian Pensioners' Party": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Russian Election 2016: Angry Grannies in the Voting Booth", "Hang in There: With No Money to Index Pensions, Russian Leaders Look to ...", "Russian Election 2016: Angry Grannies in the Voting Booth", "Putin's party triumphs in Russian legislative election amid low voter ...", "Age of retirement in Russia: Women retire at 55, men at 60", "United Russia set to rule the Duma after Sunday's election", "Pro-Putin Party Wins Landslide Victory in Russian Election", "Russian election: Putin's party wins absolute majority", "Putin\u2019s Party Gains Crushing Win in Parliamentary Elections", "Elections 2016: An Overwelming Victory for the Kremlin", "Hang in There: With No Money to Index Pensions, Russian Leaders Look to ...", "United Russia halts popularity slide as Russian election looms", "New rules for Duma elections \u2013 DW \u2013 08/16/2016 - dw.com", "Predictions: will United Russia get 50% or not? - LetsRun.com", "Russia is facing a pension dilemma as the country goes to the polls", "Russia stays loyal to Kremlin in election with record low turnout", "US election 2016: Why Russia is celebrating Trump win - BBC", "Putin firms control with big win for Russia's ruling party", "Vladimir Putin\u2019s party wins again - The Economist", "Putin's Party Maintains Tight Grip Over Russian Duma Elections"], "1": {"Title": "Russian Election 2016: Angry Grannies in the Voting Booth", "Snippet": "Russian pensioners have reason to be angry: They\u2019ve been among the hardest hit by Western sanctions and low oil prices.

There were concerns over the conduct of the election, as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted significant challenges (10). Russia was also accused of interfering in the election results of other countries, such as the US (2,3,4,8).
