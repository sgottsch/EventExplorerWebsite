The ruling coalition government collapsed, leading to the dissolution of parliament by President Petro Poroshenko and calling for early elections (8, 12). The All-Ukrainian Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) Association, led by Yulia Tymoshenko, was one of the principal political parties in Ukraine (14). The work of the new parliament started on November 27, 2014 and a coalition was formed by five factions (16). Five parties managed to clear the 5% threshold in the snap elections: Petro Poroshenko Bloc, People's Front, Self Reliance, Radical Party, and Fatherland (13). The official results of the election were announced on November 10, 2014 (13). The election was seen as a win for democracy in Ukraine (19)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2014/September/16", "Text": "Ukraine signs an agreement with the European Union to deepen economic and political ties.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2014/October/25", "Text": "The United States congratulates the thousands of candidates and millions of voters in Ukraine who have campaigned in the country's parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2014/October/26", "Text": "Regular elections are held in Ukraine for the Verkhovna Rada.", "Articles": ["3", "4", "8", "12", "16", "17"]}, {"Date": "2014/October/27", "Text": "Nationalism emerges as the winner in the Ukrainian parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["5", "11", "15", "19"]}, {"Date": "2014/October/30", "Text": "The political landscape changes but conflict remains with hardliners Yatsenyuk and Turchynov's People's Front polling well.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2014/November/10", "Text": "The Central Election Commission announces the official results of the Rada election.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2014/December/2", "Text": "The second Yatsenyuk government is approved.", "Articles": ["16"]}]}}}
