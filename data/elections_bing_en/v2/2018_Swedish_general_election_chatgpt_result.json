The Social Democratic Party (SAP), led by outgoing Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven, achieved the weakest result in its history (1). According to polls, the SAP was expected to come out ahead with 24.2% of the vote (4). However, the Democrats of Sweden were expected to win with 21.6% of the vote (4). The Swedish general election has been seen as a test of the center-right and center-left parties' resilience to the rise of right-wing populism (8).
