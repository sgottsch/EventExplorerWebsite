However, the election resulted in the lowest combined share of first preferences for Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael (9). The election was called following the dissolution of the 32nd D\u00e1il by the president, at the request of the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar (1). The indirect election to the 26th Seanad took place after the election, with postal ballots due on March 30th and 31st (2). The election was held for 49 of the 60 seats in the Seanad (2). Despite Fine Gael's defeat, President Michael D Higgins expressed confidence in the political process (3). There is some discussion about implementing Saturday voting to increase turnout in future elections (4). In the 33rd D\u00e1il, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael hold an equal number of seats (8). The Labour party leader and Social Democrat co-leader were both re-elected to the D\u00e1il (8). On the other hand, Joan Burton, former t\u00e1naiste and Labour Party leader, lost her seat (6). Mary Lou McDonald, the only candidate to replace Gerry Adams, was elected as the new president of Sinn F\u00e9in (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2020/January/14", "Text": "The 32nd D\u00e1il is dissolved by President Michael D Higgins at the request of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2020/February/8", "Text": "General election takes place to elect the 33rd D\u00e1il, with Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, and Sinn F\u00e9in tied in first preference votes.", "Articles": ["2", "4", "5", "10"]}, {"Date": "2020/February/9", "Text": "Sinn F\u00e9in tops the first preference poll in the election, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald describing the results as historic.", "Articles": ["6", "7"]}, {"Date": "2020/February/11", "Text": "General election results are finalized, with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael receiving the lowest combined share of first preferences in history.", "Articles": ["3", "8"]}, {"Date": "2020/February/14", "Text": "The 33rd D\u00e1il is formed with the lowest combined share of first preferences for Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael.", "Articles": ["9"]}]}, "When": {"upper_aspect": "no upper aspect", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["2020 Seanad election - Wikipedia", "Irish general election: What happens next? - BBC", "As it happened: Irish election results and analysis - BBC News", "Irish general election: Who is Mary Lou McDonald? - BBC News", "General Election Ireland Live: Updates as voting under ... - Irish Mirror", "General Election 2020 TV debate recap as Leo Varadkar ... - Irish Mirror", "Irish general election: What happens next? - BBC News", "Irish general election to be held on 8 February - BBC News", "Irish general election: Sinn F\u00e9in celebrate historic result - BBC", "Irish general election called for February 8 - IrishCentral", "General Election 2020 Ireland: Voting is under way in ... - Irish Mirror", "As it happened: Irish election results and analysis - BBC News", "General Election Ireland 2020: Fine Gael's Leo Varadkar ... - Irish Mirror", "2020 in Ireland - Wikipedia", "The general election of 2020 was surprising from beginning to end", "Irish general election: Sinn F\u00e9in tops first preference poll - BBC", "Irish general election: Profile of Irish political parties - BBC News", "General Election 2020 Ireland: Live updates as country ... - Irish Mirror", "General Election 2020 results - The Irish Sun", "General Election 2020: What happens next? - Irish Mirror"], "1": {"Title": "2020 Seanad election - Wikipedia", "Snippet": "An indirect election to the 26th Seanad took place after the 2020 Irish general election, with postal ballots due on 30 and 31 March.

Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin was re-elected to the D\u00e1il (9), and his party ultimately won the most seats (7). This was a significant change from the previous election, where they had only won 44.5% of the vote (10). The election also resulted in the lowest combined share of first preferences for Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael (7).

The election was held to elect the 33rd D\u00e1il, the lower house of Ireland's parliament, with 60 seats in total (2,3). One notable aspect of the election was that Varadkar became the first sitting Taoiseach in the history of the State not to top a General Election poll (4,6).
