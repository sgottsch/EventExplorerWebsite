The incumbent president, Anatoly Bibilov, was elected with a convincing victory (3, 13, 16). The election sparked controversy as it was followed by a referendum on amending the region's constitution to rename it the Republic of South Ossetia (7, 8). The proposed name change was seen as provocative by Georgia (10). The election also led to concerns about the integration of South Ossetian soldiers into the Russian army (6, 9, 18). The region's ties with Russia were further strengthened as it plans to open embassies in the self-proclaimed Donbass republics (14). The conflict between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia remains unresolved (19)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/February/8", "Text": "The de facto president of South Ossetia announces a referendum on changing the region's name to the Republic of South Ossetia.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2017/March/14", "Text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin approves the integration of some South Ossetian military units into the Russian army.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2017/March/17", "Text": "A referendum is held in South Ossetia to change the region's name to the Republic of South Ossetia.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/2", "Text": "Vladimir Putin meets with newly-elected South Ossetian President Anatoly Bibilov and discusses economic cooperation.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/9", "Text": "Anatoly Bibilov is elected as the new de facto president of South Ossetia.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/15", "Text": "The Russian government approves the co-financing of salaries for employees of state and municipal agencies in South Ossetia.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/21", "Text": "Vladimir Putin congratulates Anatoly Bibilov on his victory in the presidential election and his inauguration as president of South Ossetia.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/2", "Text": "Vladimir Putin meets with Anatoly Bibilov to discuss economic cooperation between Russia and South Ossetia.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/17", "Text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin approves the co-financing of salaries for employees of state and municipal agencies in South Ossetia.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/30", "Text": "South Ossetia announces plans to open embassies in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/1", "Text": "South Ossetian President Anatoly Bibilov meets with the President of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, to discuss pressure from Western countries and the wish to strengthen cooperation between the two regions.", "Articles": ["5", "8"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/2", "Text": "Anatoly Bibilov announces plans to hold a referendum on South Ossetia joining Russia.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/4", "Text": "The number of South Ossetians serving in the Russian army is expected to grow.", "Articles": ["9", "18"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/7", "Text": "Piotr Gasiev is confirmed as the new head of South Ossetia's legislature.", "Articles": ["13"]}]}}}
