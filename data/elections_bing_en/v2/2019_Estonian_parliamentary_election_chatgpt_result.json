The election also set a new digital record for online voting, with almost half of the votes cast online (8). The incumbent president Petro Poroshenko was defeated by political newcomer and TV comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the first round of elections in Ukraine on March 31, 2019 (2). The OSCE and other international organizations deployed observer delegations to monitor the election (10). A Needs Assessment Mission was also undertaken by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) prior to the election (3). Other countries, such as Finland, also observed the election (9). The Moldovan parliamentary election, which took place on February 24, 2019, resulted in a hung parliament with no party obtaining a majority (6). However, the opposition Socialist party gathered the highest number of seats (34) (6). The incumbent Democratic party obtained the second highest number of seats (30), while the ACUM platform became the third biggest force in Parliament (27 seats) (6).
