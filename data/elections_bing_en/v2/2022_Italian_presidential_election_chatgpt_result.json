The election, which is held every seven years, involves 1009 electors and no official candidates (4,8). After several rounds of voting, Italian President Sergio Mattarella was re-elected for a second term on January 29, 2022 (2,3,5,6,10). The election has been described as having similarities to a papal election (4). Mattarella's re-election ended a political stalemate that had lasted for several days (5). The president is elected by a joint session of parliament and regional delegates, with a two-thirds majority needed in the first three rounds of voting (8). In addition to the presidential election, the Italian parliament also received a video address from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 22, 2022 (7). The election also follows the death of European Parliament president David Sassoli in an Italian hospital on January 11, 2022 (9)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/January/21", "Text": "Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi meet during a Youth4Climate pre-COP26 event in Milan, Italy.", "Articles": ["1", "8"]}, {"Date": "2022/January/29", "Text": "Sergio Mattarella is re-elected as President of Italy after a week of fraught voting in Parliament.", "Articles": ["2", "5", "6", "10"]}, {"Date": "2022/March/23", "Text": "Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the Italian Parliament via video link.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2022/January/11", "Text": "EU Parliament President David Sassoli dies in an Italian hospital.", "Articles": ["9"]}]}, "Result": {"upper_aspect": "no upper aspect", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["2023 Nigerian presidential election - Wikipedia", "Sergio Mattarella re-elected as Italian president for a second term", "Italian President Sergio Mattarella elected to 2nd term, ending ...", "Italian lawmakers cast mostly blank ballots in 1st round of ...", "Sergio Mattarella: At 80, Italy president re-elected on amid ... - BBC", "Italian President Sergio Mattarella re-elected, ending impasse - Al Jazeera", "PDP conducts presidential primary election May 28, 29", "Italy's President, 80-year-old Sergio Mattarella, recruited to stay on ...", "Sergio Mattarella re-elected as Italian president for a second term", "2023 Turkish presidential election - Wikipedia", "Sergio Mattarella: Italian president secures re-election that will keep ...", "South Korean conservative declares win in presidential race", "Stalemate continues in Italian presidential election", "2023 Ecuadorian general election - Wikipedia", "Italians Vote for a President.
