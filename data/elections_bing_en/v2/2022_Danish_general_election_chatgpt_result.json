The election will also see the inclusion of the leader of the Liberal Party and a former prime minister in key jobs (1). The Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, is expected to be the largest party elected (4, 14). Other parties participating in the election include the Liberal Party (2, 4, 10), the Faroe Islands (2), and Greenland (2). The election has been announced by the Prime Minister 7 months ahead of schedule (15). There has been some controversy surrounding the election, with the Faroe Islands requesting a postponement due to a day of remembrance for those who have died at sea (11). However, the date has not been changed and the election will proceed as planned (10). Other issues being discussed in the election include a new formation centrist party (8), concerns about healthcare in remote areas (6, 7), and the impact of immigration on the country (13). Overall, the election is expected to be highly contested and could potentially result in a change in government (2, 11)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/October/5", "Text": "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announces that a general election will be held on November 1, 2022.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/11", "Text": "Inuit Ataqatgiit presents their three candidates for the upcoming general election.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/18", "Text": "Early general elections are announced for November 1, 2022.", "Articles": ["11", "14"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/20", "Text": "Inger St\u00f8jberg proposes a reform to ensure that there are enough social workers in rural areas.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/24", "Text": "S\u00f8ren Pape Poulsen is cleared of breaking COVID-19 guidelines by traveling to the Dominican Republic.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2022/October/26", "Text": "Sofie Carsten Nielsen is accused of tax evasion.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/1", "Text": "Denmark holds its general election.", "Articles": ["3", "5", "8", "10", "12", "17", "20"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/3", "Text": "New Borgerlige is affected by external factors, including the formation of a new party by Inger St\u00f8jberg.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/7", "Text": "Vote-by-mail ballots must be postmarked on or before Election Day.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/8", "Text": "The general election results are expected to be finalized by December 8, 2022.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/11", "Text": "Nye Borgerlige is affected by external factors, including the survival of Dansk Folkeparti.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/27", "Text": "The Greens and teals experience major swings in the Victorian election, but only one Green MP is elected.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2022/November/28", "Text": "The Swedish Riksdag election results in a close victory for the centre-right bloc.", "Articles": ["18"]}]}}}
