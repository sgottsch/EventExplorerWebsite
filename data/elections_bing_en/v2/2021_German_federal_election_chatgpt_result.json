The state's rust belt Ruhr area proved to be a stronghold for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) (10). The election also saw a surge in support for the SPD (5). The state's current premier, Armin Laschet, faced criticism for his handling of the floods (1). The candidates for chancellor, including Olaf Scholz of the SPD, faced off in a TV debate (7).
