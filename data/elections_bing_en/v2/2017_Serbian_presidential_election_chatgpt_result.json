Stamatovi\u0107 has also spoken about the need for change and the importance of protecting natural resources (8,10). He has also stated that he will not allow changes to the Serbian constitution (6) and has criticized the current government's handling of the country's economic development (7). Stamatovi\u0107's political career has been closely followed, with articles discussing his potential candidacy for president (1), his views on the development of Zlatibor (5), and his relationship with the current government (2,3,4).

Parovi\u0107's campaign also focused on the future of the country and the younger generation, claiming that they should not be held responsible for the events of the 1990s (8,10). He also proposed the creation of a \"state cooperative of Serbia\" (5).
