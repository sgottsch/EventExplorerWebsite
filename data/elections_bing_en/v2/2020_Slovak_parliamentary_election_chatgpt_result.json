The discourse during the election was dominated by the party's policies (1). The election also highlighted the issue of journalist's murder, with Fico ruling out a coalition with the far-right Our Slovakia LSNS party (3). The senior ruling leftist Smer-Social Democracy party gained 18.3% of the vote, but its support fell below 17% (9). The populist SMER-SD party, which has been in power for most of the past 14 years, gained 28.3% in the last election in 2016 (9). The senior ruling leftist Smer-Social Democracy party was also in second place with 18.3% of the vote (9). The analysis of online information space prior to the election provided key recommendations on how to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content on social media (7). The senior ruling leftist Smer-Social Democracy party held a narrow lead in the final poll before the election (8). The parliamentary election also saw the use of parliament by ruling parties Smer and the Slovak National Party (SNS) for their campaigns (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2020/February/29", "Text": "Smer-Social Democracy wins 18.3% of the vote in the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["1", "3"]}, {"Date": "2020/February/14", "Text": "The final pre-election poll shows the Smer-Social Democracy party with a narrow lead.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2020/February/27", "Text": "Smer-Social Democracy rules out a post-election coalition with far-right party Our Slovakia.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2020/February/12", "Text": "The only Hungarian party in parliament is Most-Hid, a member of the governing coalition led by Smer-Social Democracy.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2020/February/11", "Text": "Smer-Social Democracy and the Slovak National Party relocate their campaigns to parliament.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2020/March/1", "Text": "Smer-Social Democracy is officially confirmed as the second-place winner of the parliamentary election.", "Articles": ["1", "9"]}, {"Date": "2020/March/2", "Text": "Igor Matovi\u010d's Ordinary People and Independent Personalities wins the parliamentary election, ending Smer-Social Democracy's rule.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2020/April/25", "Text": "The final report of the observation mission for the 2020 Slovak parliamentary elections is released.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2020/April/28", "Text": "GLOBSEC and MEMO98 organize a discussion on social media and the Slovak parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["2", "7"]}, {"Date": "2020/April/29", "Text": "The Democracy & Resilience Programme provides policy recommendations for addressing misinformation and harmful content on social media in the context of the Slovak parliamentary elections.", "Articles": ["7"]}]}, "Result": {"upper_aspect": "no upper aspect", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["File : 2020 Slovak parliamentary election vote map.svg - Wikimedia", "Right-Wing Extremists Could Win Big in Slovak Election", "Results of the Parliamentary Elections in Slovakia 29 February 2020 ...", "2020 Slovak parliamentary election - Wikiwand", "FINAL REPORT - MISSION TO THE 2020 SLOVAK PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS", "SLOVAK PARLIAMENTARY... - LSESU Central European Conference - Facebook", "Slovakia | 2020 Elections | CSIS", "Slovakia's anti-graft opposition party wins parliamentary elections by ...", "Slovakia: Election 2020 (election night) - spectator.sme.sk", "General Election Results of 29 February 2020 in Slovakia", "Slovak Republic - Parliamentary elections - 29 February 2020", "Wind of change \u2013 but what kind of change?
