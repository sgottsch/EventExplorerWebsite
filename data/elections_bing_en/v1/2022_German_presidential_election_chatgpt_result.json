The election was largely symbolic as the president's role is not one of significant authority (1). This election was considered to be an important one in 2023, as it was the first time in Turkish history that the presidential election went to a runoff (2). The election was originally scheduled for June 18 but was moved up by a month (2). The reelection of Steinmeier was widely praised and he received 77% support at the Bundesversammlung (7). There were four state elections set for 2022 in Germany, including the presidential election (9).

He was initially elected in 2017 and is eligible for a second term (1, 2). His victory was widely expected and seen as a symbol of consensus and continuity in German politics (7, 14). The election took place in the Paul-L\u00f6be-Haus parliamentary building in Berlin (4). Steinmeier's re-election was congratulated by Chinese President Xi Jinping (6). The role of President in Germany is largely symbolic, but the holder is the country's highest authority (5). The 2022 German presidential election was seen as a foregone conclusion, with Steinmeier winning 77% of the vote (14). The election also marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Germany (6). This election was one of four important elections taking place in Germany in 2022 (15)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2022/01/05", "Text": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier is announced as the presidential candidate for the 2022 German election.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2022/01/09", "Text": "Four German states will hold elections in 2022, giving the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) four chances to regain their losses from the previous general election.", "Articles": ["15"]}, {"Date": "2022/02/08", "Text": "Campaigning for the 2022 Philippine election begins.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2022/02/12", "Text": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier is overwhelmingly re-elected as German president.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2022/02/13", "Text": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier is re-elected for a second term as Germany's president.", "Articles": ["5", "9", "7"]}, {"Date": "2022/02/14", "Text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulates Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his re-election.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2022/02/15", "Text": "Friedrich Merz takes over as the leader of Germany's main opposition party.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2022/03/09", "Text": "Yoon Suk-yeol is elected as South Korea's new president.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2022/04/01", "Text": "Former senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. proclaims his presidential bid for the 2022 Philippine election.", "Articles": ["20"]}, {"Date": "2022/04/04", "Text": "Viktor Orban of Hungary wins a fourth consecutive landslide victory in the country's national election.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2022/04/05", "Text": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier admits to mistakes over Germany's relations with Russia.", "Articles": ["17"]}, {"Date": "2022/05/07", "Text": "Snap general elections are held in Ecuador, with a run-off election taking place on October 15th.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2022/12/19", "Text": "Gabriel Boric wins the Chilean presidential election.", "Articles": ["19"]}, {"Date": "2023/06/18", "Text": "The Turkish presidential election takes place, going to a run-off for the first time in the country's history.", "Articles": ["11"]}]}}}
