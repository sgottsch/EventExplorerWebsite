Notably, Labour was pushed back by other parties, including Plaid Cymru, in both English and Welsh elections (2). Plaid Cymru was also mentioned as losing some vote share (9).\n\nThere were also discussions about the role of Plaid Cymru in Welsh politics, with some speculating on potential alliances and deals with other parties (3, 4). Private innovation in Wales was also a topic of discussion in light of these elections (5).\n\nIn terms of national politics, British MPs accused Prime Minister Rajoy of breaching freedom of speech by prosecuting former Catalan politicians (6). Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour party, was expected to perform poorly in the general elections on June 8 (7). There were also discussions about Labour's loss of seats in local elections and the potential for them to form a minority government again (10).", "Metadata": {"date range start": "26/April/2017", "date range end": "11/June/2017", "locations": ["Wales", "Welsh"], "subjects": ["Local Elections", "Labour Party", "Conservative Party", "Liberal Democrats", "Plaid Cymru", "Autonomous Legislative Bodies", "Scottish National Party", "Republic", "Minority Government"]}}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/May/4", "Text": "Conservatives increase their share by over 550 seats in local elections, while Labour loses over 380.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/26", "Text": "The Labour Party is predicted to lose hundreds of seats in the upcoming local elections.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/5", "Text": "The Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru experiences a decrease in vote share compared to 2015.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/3", "Text": "Labour and Plaid Cymru form a minority government in the Welsh Assembly.", "Articles": ["7", "10"]}]}, "United Kingdom": {"upper_aspect": "where", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Local elections | The Guardian", "", "", "Hillary Clinton to meet with Belarus rights activisits - Worldnews.com", "Conservatives agree pact with DUP to support May government - BBC News", "British Future", "", "Local elections | The Guardian", "Governments usually fear local elections, but this time it's Labour running scared", "Le Taurillon, magazine eurocitoyen", "Representation of the People Act 1985", "Languages Spoken in Each Country of the World | Infoplease", "Conservative manifesto rules out soft Brexit | The Week UK", "News", "", "Politics | The Guardian", "UK Polling Report", "Conservatives agree pact with DUP to support May government - BBC News", "UK News and Opinion - HuffPost UK", "How to watch the British election like a pro \u2013 POLITICO"], "1": {"Title": "Local elections | The Guardian", "Snippet": " ...

The elections were seen as an indicator of Brexit voting patterns (6,13,19) and a prediction of the 2017 General Election results (2,3,5,12). The Welsh government had previously urged its citizens to register to vote in the General Election (4). Welsh politicians and party leaders such as Carwyn Jones of the Labour Party and Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru were mentioned in several articles (5,7,11). The elections also raised discussions about EU funding in Wales (18) and cybercrime related to elections (20). Some articles also referenced age discrepancies in voting turnout (15,16).", "Metadata": {"date range start": "5/May/2017", "date range end": "6/June/2017", "locations": ["Wales", "Cardiff City Council", "Cardiff", "Plaid Cymru", "London"], "subjects": ["Local Elections 2017", "Labour", "Tories", "General Election", "purdah", "Brexit", "EU Referendum", "British", "EU27"]}}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/May/5", "Text": "Cardiff City Council, controlled by Welsh Labour, retains control amid nationwide losses for the party.", "Articles": ["1", "7"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/6", "Text": "The local elections see the Tories gain over 550 seats and Labour loses over 380.", "Articles": ["2", "3"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/26", "Text": "The local elections continue with Labour avoiding possible losses in Wales to Plaid Cymru, Tories, Lib Dems, and UKIP.", "Articles": ["5", "8"]}, {"Date": "2017/April/28", "Text": "Carwyn Jones, Welsh Labour leader, calls snap election to compete with the Tories.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/18", "Text": "The Combined Authorities (Mayoral Elections) Order 2017 is published, allowing for mayoral elections.", "Articles": ["19"]}]}}}
