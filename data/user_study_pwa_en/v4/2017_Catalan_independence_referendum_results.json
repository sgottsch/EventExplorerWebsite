The referendum is expected to pass by a large margin and lead to the declaration of independence (3). However, the Spanish government has appealed to the courts to prevent the referendum from being held (10). The referendum is seen as a culmination of President Carles Puigdemont's lifelong drive for independence (9). Other European countries have faced similar issues, such as a proposed referendum in Scotland in 2014 (7). The result of the Catalan independence vote will ultimately be decided by either conciliation or revolution (8). The independence movement has sparked debates about language autonomy within the autonomous communities (1).", "Metadata": {"date range start": "1/August/2017", "date range end": "4/October/2017", "locations": ["Catalonia", "Spain", "Madrid"], "subjects": ["Independence Referendum", "National Question", "Constituent Assembly Elections"]}}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/July/26", "Text": "In Greece, the situation becomes revolutionary, as the beginning of a crucial test for independence approaches.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/July/28", "Text": "The independence referendum in Greece and the Catalan national question take center stage.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/August/2", "Text": "Spain's prime minister asks the court to rule on the Catalan independence vote.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2017/August/3", "Text": "On the day of the Catalan independence referendum, Greek farmers block German lorries.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/29", "Text": "The president of Greece calls for a referendum on Catalan independence.", "Articles": ["9"]}]}, "No-Aspect": {"upper_aspect": "no upper aspect", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["World news | The Guardian", "Boing Boing", "EUobserver", "Catalan independence - POLITICO", "Enric Juliana | VoxEurop.eu: European news, cartoons and press reviews", "NYT > Today\u2019s Paper", "People and Places: Juan Carlos signs his own abdication into law", "NPR : National Public Radio : News & Analysis, World, US, Music & Arts : NPR", "Why pro-independence Catalans envy Scotland - BBC News", "Why pro-independence Catalans envy Scotland - BBC News", "Why pro-independence Catalans envy Scotland - BBC News", "est100 \u4e00\u4e9b\u651d\u5f71(some photos): \"consultation of citizens\", Catalan pro-independence demonstrator, in Barc", "Today in Social Sciences...", "Vox Popoli: 2017-06-04", "spain / Boing Boing", "Open Europe: Spain", "Why pro-independence Catalans envy Scotland - BBC News", "the unbalanced evolution of homo sapiens: Catalonia announced independence referendum for October", "The way forward in Greece - World Socialist Web Site", "Greece: Situation becoming revolutionary | Greece | Europe"], "1": {"Title": "World news | The Guardian", "Snippet": "/world/live/2017/oct/01/catalan-independence-referendum-spain-catalonia-vote-live&quot;&gt;referendum earlier ... =&quot; ...

The referendum was fiercely opposed by the central government in Madrid (8). In November, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont called for a non-binding independence referendum (4). The Catalan government affirmed the right of the Catalan people to decide by voting (8). Ahead of the referendum, thousands of people rallied in Madrid's Puerta del Sol in support of Catalan independence (6). However, opinion polls showed a lack of a favourable majority for either the referendum or for Catalan independence (3). The Catalonian independence movement was compared to the Scottish independence movement (5). Overall, the 2017 Catalan independence referendum and its cause were key events in the year's political landscape.", "Metadata": {"date range start": "1/October/2017", "date range end": "28/November/2017", "locations": ["Catalonia", "Spain", "UK", "Europe"], "subjects": ["Catalan independence referendum", "European Union", "Referendum", "UK devolution debate"]}}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/June/4", "Text": "The referendum for Catalan independence is announced to be held on October 1 despite criticism from Madrid.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2017/July/28", "Text": "An alliance for independence fails to secure a majority in Catalan elections.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2017/August/4", "Text": "The Catalan People's Party is due to vote on proposals concerning Catalonia's future.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2017/August/9", "Text": "The Catalan leader announces that a binding referendum on Catalonia's independence will be held on October 1.", "Articles": ["1", "3", "8"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/9", "Text": "The top court in Spain declares the Catalan declaration of independence to be void.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/27", "Text": "The European Parliament debates the Paradise Papers and mentions the Catalan referendum.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "", "Text": "Spain's castles come under fire: Catalonia's declaration of independence remains a statement, not a document of disconnection.

Despite protests from the Spanish government, the Catalan parliament supports the independence vote (1). On October 1, the Catalan government declared independence (2,12). However, Spain's top court officially suspended the declaration (6,7,10). In response to the events, a general strike was called in Catalonia (4). Pro-independence demonstrations were held in Barcelona, with many supporters waving Catalan flags (14,19). The election in Catalonia became a \"referendum on independence\" (16, 17, 18) and sparked comparisons to Scotland's independence movement (16, 17, 18). Some argue that the Catalan people have the right to decide their own future (20).", "Metadata": {"date range start": "1/October/2017", "date range end": "28/November/2017", "locations": ["Spain", "Catalonia", "Barcelona", "Madrid"], "subjects": ["Catalan independence", "referendum", "protest", "government"]}}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/September/30", "Text": "Citizens of Catalonia are set to vote on the question of their independence from Spain.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/1", "Text": "The Catalan government carries out a largely symbolic vote on their independence with hopes of gaining more leverage in negotiations with Spain.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/3", "Text": "The King of Spain signs the Catalan Independence into law.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/4", "Text": "An estimated half million people gather in Barcelona for a pro-independence rally.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/5", "Text": "Large scale anti-police protests break out in the streets of Catalonia after numerous reports of brutality from law enforcement during the referendum.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/10", "Text": "The Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, proclaims Catalan independence but suspends its implementation to allow for negotiations with Spain.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/21", "Text": "The Spanish government suspends Catalonia's autonomy and imposes direct rule in response to the Catalan Declaration of Independence.", "Articles": ["13"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/2", "Text": "Madrid's Supreme Court declares the Catalan Declaration of Independence illegal, officially suspending Catalonia's autonomy.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/9", "Text": "Catalonia's government continues to push for independence despite Madrid's efforts to quell separatist sentiments.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/27", "Text": "The ousted Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, calls for fresh elections in response to Madrid taking control of Catalonia.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/December/31", "Text": "Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont flees to Belgium after facing charges of rebellion from Spanish authorities.", "Articles": ["12"]}]}}}
