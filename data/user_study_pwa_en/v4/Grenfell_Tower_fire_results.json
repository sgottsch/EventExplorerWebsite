Many questions emerged following the tragedy, including why May's chief of staff Gavin Barwell failed to review fire safety regulations (10). The fire also sparked criticism of May's aloof and robotic response (4) and calls for a public inquiry (7). The death toll was initially reported as 79 (3) and became a significant topic during the snap election (9). The BBC postponed a documentary on the fire (1) and Grenfell House is a topic of discussion on Carrie Fisher's death (1).

The fire is believed to have started on the fourth floor and quickly spread (9,10). Some criticized the state's response to the disaster (8). Cladding used on the building may have contributed to its rapid spread (6). Following the fire, there were calls for the removal of the Bishop's Bench from the House of Lords (8). Amid the chaos and tragedy, stories of bravery and heroism emerged (1)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/June/14", "Text": "A massive fire engulfs Grenfell Tower in west London, leading to the death of at least 50 residents.", "Articles": ["10", "9"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/15", "Text": "Residents and community leaders express their outrage over the inadequate response of the state to the devastating fire.", "Articles": ["7", "2"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/16", "Text": "The Bishop of Gloucester calls for the removal of the Bishops' Bench from the House of Lords in light of the fire.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/17", "Text": "A man throws a baby out of a tenth floor window to save his life while the blaze rages on in Grenfell Tower.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/19", "Text": "The death toll in the Grenfell Tower fire rises to 62 as the search for more victims continues.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/20", "Text": "A vigil is held near the site of the London Grenfell Tower fire with numerous celebrities attending.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/24", "Text": "The Archbishop of Canterbury condemns the state's response to the fire as a failure of values.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/28", "Text": "Alec Marsh interviews Adele, who visited a vigil near the site of the fire in Grenfell Tower.", "Articles": ["3"]}]}, "Result": {"upper_aspect": "no upper aspect", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["UFO Sightings Hotspot: June 2017", "News Article Archive from June 19, 2017 - Wsj.com", "Politics", "Japan Infuriating Enviros By Building 45 New Coal Power Plants | NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT", "SeaWaves Magazine: HMS Monmouth", "NZ Top NZ News Stories from NZCity", "UFO Sightings Hotspot", "Triapus", "he who must not be deadnamed", "Breaking News, Entertainment, Sport, Lifestyle and Video | The Huffington Post South Africa", "853 | Greenwich borough news, issues and mutterings", "Official Tumblr of BuzzFeed dot com (the website)", "Breaking News, Entertainment, Sport, Lifestyle and Video | The Huffington Post Australia", "Official Tumblr of BuzzFeed dot com (the website)", "The View from Cullingworth", "Raheem Sterling - Sports Mole", "Forums - Unexplained Mysteries Discussion Forums", "", "X Www Form Urlencoded", "NPR : National Public Radio : News & Analysis, World, US, Music & Arts : NPR"], "1": {"Title": "UFO Sightings Hotspot: June 2017", "Snippet": " , UFO , ufos in ancient history BBC and Euro News show UFO flying past burning Grenfell Tower in London, UK As firemen fight the devastating fire at the Grenfell Tower a UFO is easily seen in the sky above.
