The film La La Land won five Bafta awards, continuing its Oscar momentum (9). The awards ceremony was also notable for being the first major event to take place at the new Royal Albert Hall (7). No film attempted to replicate the success of Slumdog Millionaire in 2009 by winning both the People's Choice Award at the Toronto Film Festival and the Oscar for Best Picture (10). On the other hand, the animation category remains elusive for director Wes Anderson who filmed The Isle of Dogs in England (10).", "Metadata": {"date range start": "8/January/2017", "date range end": "1/March/2017", "locations": ["London", "Royal Opera House", "England", "Cannes", "Los Angeles"], "subjects": ["Movies", "Academy Awards", "Cannes Film Festival", "David Bowie's birthday", "Political satire"]}}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/January/5", "Text": "David Bowie's 70th birthday concerts are announced for January 8.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2017/February/1", "Text": "Actress Gemma Jones, best known for her role in British film and television, passes away at the age of 70.

The film \"Zero Dark Thirty\" was nominated for one of the Best Picture flub at last month's Academy Awards (2, 4). \"Mission Impossible 6\" and Rupert Sanders' \"Rub and Chug\" are the post-Oscar films about to be nominated for four Academy Awards (8). The film \"Ben-Hur\" would have garnered more Oscar glory thanks to its huge budget that made it virtually conquer the world of CGI (9). Planet of the Wars may be the 2001-2002 BAFTA winner for Best Live-Action Short Film (3). Director Andrew Payne stars in one of the projects, which is what won the 2008 German Writing Turnaround Award (8).
