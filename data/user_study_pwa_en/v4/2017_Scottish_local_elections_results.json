Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson made headlines with her campaigning efforts and was favored by some as a leader of the opposition (1). On election day, the Scottish Conservatives gained a record number of seats under Davidson's leadership (8). Despite this, there were doubts raised about the Tory deal with the DUP and the potential for it to damage the union (7). A record number of LGBTQ candidates ran in the election, including Davidson who is openly lesbian (9). According to a Lord Ashcroft Poll, Davidson was ranked third among Tory hopefuls after Theresa May and Boris Johnson (10). Jeremy Corbyn and Gillian Anderson also played a role in the lead up to the elections, with Corbyn giving a speech on Europe (3) and Anderson appearing in a tweet posted by Davidson (4,5).", "Metadata": {"date range start": "4/March/2017", "date range end": "13/June/2017", "locations": ["Scotland"], "subjects": ["Scottish elections", "Ruth Davidson", "SNP", "Tories", "LGBTQ", "Union"]}}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/March/4", "Text": "The Times reports on the upcoming Scottish local elections, showing a rise in popularity for Ruth Davidson as a potential opposition leader.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2017/May/7", "Text": "Ruth Davidson secures a record number of seats for the Scottish Conservative party in the local elections, sending a strong message to the SNP about preserving the Union.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/9", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn and Ruth Davidson are among the top candidates for preferred party leader amongst LGBTQ voters.", "Articles": ["6", "9"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/12", "Text": "The elections result in a record number of LGBTQ members in Parliament, including Ruth Davidson.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/13", "Text": "Lord Ashcroft Polls releases data on the preferences of voters for party leaders, with Ruth Davidson coming in third.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/4", "Text": "Ruth Davidson is included in a list of people associated with Jeremy Corbyn in a series of news articles.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/July/1", "Text": "Ruth Davidson ruffles feathers by posting a picture on Twitter with Gillian Anderson.", "Articles": ["4", "5"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/10", "Text": "An article from UK Polling Report highlights the opinions of voters about the Conservative and Scottish National parties, with a focus on Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/July/3", "Text": "The Guardian publishes an article discussing the potential impact of a DUP and Tory alliance on the Union and Thatcherite policies, referencing Ruth Davidson.", "Articles": ["7"]}]}, "Nicola Sturgeon": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["", "Breitbart London Articles - Breitbart", "Breitbart London Articles - Breitbart", "NYT > Today\u2019s Paper", "Brexit and citizenship | New Europeans", "The Times & The Sunday Times", "Politics | The Guardian", "", "The power of storytelling | Rebel Yarns", "Finance", "The Times & The Sunday Times", "Survey finds 52% of people in Scotland not religious - Evening Express", "The Brexit poll | The Psychologist", "Scottish Conservatives", "Indyref2: A bold but unsurprising move from Nicola Sturgeon \u2013 UCL Brexit Blog", "What to Look for as U.K. Voters Go to the Polls in a Volatile Year - The New York Times", "Freedom of Movement Why it is central to Brexit negotiations - University of Strathclyde", "Stocks, pound fall again due to UK vote uncertainty | WWLP.com", "", "Angela Merkel stands by refugee policy despite AfD gains \u2013 POLITICO"], "1": {"Title": "", "Snippet": " Jun 2017 16:49:53 +0100  ... -theresa-may-spoof-1-4467560 national elections National 1.4467560 Tue, 6 Jun 2017 14:08:54 +0100 http ... .scotsman.com/business/companies/energy/nicola-sturgeon-hails-great-success-of-oil-and-gas-industry-1 ...
