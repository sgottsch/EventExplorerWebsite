In 2018, he crashed at the Belgian Grand Prix (3) and in 2019, Hamilton won at the Bahrain Grand Prix while Leclerc saw his hopes of a first victor stripped (4). In 2020, he changed teams, joining Ferrari and pairing with Vettel (7). Leclerc and Hamilton are two of the sport's young champions, making the coming seasons particularly interesting (7). Virtual Grand Prix allowed fans to watch Leclerc race in a simulation of the cancelled event (6). In the 2020 2020 Formula One season, Leclerc fell just behind his rival, Sainz jr (8).
