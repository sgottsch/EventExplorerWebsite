They occurred on June 3 and involved a white van that mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge (1,6, 11). One of the attackers, Rachid Redouane, had been previously been involved in a wife battery and was a known follower of A'isha bint Abu Bakr, the widow of The Prophet Muhammed Islamist Sleeper City - London Bridge Knifed Immigrants. (10) The Borough Market incident involved the same van, as did the first London attack. (12) Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a former member of rap group Mac Possims able.com was among the group behind the beheading of journalist James Foley in Syria. (13)\nA police office was stabbed in the face during the attack. (5,14) The attackers, Muslim convert Abu Izzadeen (a.k.a., Trevor Richard Brooks), Michael Adebowale, Mohamed Sakr, and Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale, were involved in a terror incident described as part of \"pure evil\" by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. (2,8) Police said they believe the Islamic State (IS) jihadists were part of a terror network. (4) They were also identified as Muslims from East London (3).\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, there were calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May, who was blamed for not doing enough to prevent such attacks. (16) Religious leaders across various faiths expressed their sadness and shock at the incident and offered prayers for the victims. (20) There were also reports of heroism and acts of bravery by civilians and emergency responders during the attack. (18,19)\nThe attack sparked debates about immigration and border control policies and fuelled existing tensions between different communities in London. (9,15)\nThe incident reignited discussions about the role of social media and the internet in radicalizing individuals. (17)\nThis was the third major terror attack to occur in the UK in 2017, following the Westminster attack in March and the Manchester Arena bombing in May. (11,14) It also added to the rising number of terror attacks happening around the world. (3,4,6)\nReferences:\n1.
