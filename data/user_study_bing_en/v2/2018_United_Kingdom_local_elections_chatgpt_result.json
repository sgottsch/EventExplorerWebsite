In April, he was accused of antisemitism within his party (1). In June, he claimed success at the Labour Live festival and promised to recognize Palestine as a state if elected (2,4). He also received an invitation to visit Israel, which he accepted (5). He has faced criticism and pressure from other parties and members of his own party, particularly on issues such as Brexit (3,9). In March, he faced backlash for his response to the Salisbury poisoning, which was seen as too lenient towards Russia (7). However, despite these events, Corbyn remains a popular figure within the Labour Party (6,8,10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/April/3", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn is accused of being complacent in anti-Semitism within the UK Labour Party.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/3", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn responds to an invitation from Israel's Labour party to visit the country.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/16", "Text": "Labour Live festival is deemed a success by Jeremy Corbyn.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/24", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn states that the UK would recognize Palestine as a state under a Labour government.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/25", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn is declared the winner in Turkey's presidential election.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/25", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure from local Labour parties to back a second Brexit referendum.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/26", "Text": "A biography about Jeremy Corbyn's path to power is nominated for the 2017 Bread & Roses Award for Radical Publishing.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/12", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn unites MPs in response to the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/15", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn participates in the Young Labour Elections.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2018/June/3", "Text": "Jeremy Corbyn expresses his love for the BBC in a comedy sketch.", "Articles": ["6"]}]}, "2018 North East Lincolnshire Council Election": {"upper_aspect": "other", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Calderdale local election", "Local council elections 2018 - ITV News", "Here's the all-women, all-BAME Labour shortlist to replace Heidi Alexander", "Local elections 2018 \u2013 as it happened | Varsity", "What are the Bury local elections 2018 results?", "Jersey General Election 2018 - BBC News", "Local election results 2018: As it happened - BBC News", "Local elections 2018: Final voting in English council polls", "Local elections 2018: As it happened - BBC", "Nuclear missiles were a short drive from Grimsby and nearly destroyed ...", "City of San Jos\u00e9 Elections - 2018 | City of San Jos\u00e9", "How bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?", "Lebanese elections 2018: Live updates | The National", "Turkey election 2018 - BBC News", "Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: The Scandal and the Fallout So Far", "Turnout low in Lebanon\u2019s first parliamentary election in 9 years", "North-East Election Result 2018: \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u0915\u0947 ... - Jansatta", "Meghalaya Assembly election 2018: How to understand poll results in ...", "Conservatives gain a seat and hold majority in Southend", "Hungary Election Was Free but Not Entirely Fair, Observers Say"], "1": {"Title": "Calderdale local election", "Snippet": "The Calderdale local election was held on 3 May 2018.", "URL": "https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/elections/local.calderdale.2018-05-03/calderdale-local-election/", "Date": "2018-05-03"}, "2": {"Title": "Local council elections 2018 - ITV News", "Snippet": "Council elections in England were held on Thursday 3 May 2018.
