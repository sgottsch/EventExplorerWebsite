The incident left the two in critical condition, with many believing that it was a targeted assassination attempt (1, 2). However, both Skripals have since been discharged from the hospital (3, 20). The attack sparked international tensions and resulted in several diplomatic responses (8, 9). Investigations revealed that the Skripals were under Russian surveillance prior to the attack (12, 18). The reasons behind the attack are still unknown, with some speculating it was for revenge or to silence Skripal (5, 14)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2018/March/4", "Text": "Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, UK.", "Articles": ["2", "12", "17"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/7", "Text": "Reports emerge that a nerve agent was used to try to kill Sergei and Yulia Skripal.", "Articles": ["16", "19"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/9", "Text": "Sergei and Yulia Skripal remain in a critical condition in hospital.", "Articles": ["2", "5", "10", "14"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/13", "Text": "Sky News reports that it is easy to jump to conclusions about who is behind the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/16", "Text": "British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson states that it is 'overwhelmingly likely' that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2018/March/24", "Text": "Theresa May gives Russia a deadline to explain their involvement in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.", "Articles": ["9"]}, {"Date": "2018/April/24", "Text": "Nearly two months after the poisoning, investigations into the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal continue in Salisbury.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/18", "Text": "Sergei and Yulia Skripal are discharged from the hospital, less than three months after the nerve agent attack.", "Articles": ["3", "20"]}, {"Date": "2018/May/29", "Text": "Medical professionals express amazement at the recovery of Sergei and Yulia Skripal from the nerve agent attack.", "Articles": ["4", "6"]}, {"Date": "2018/July/4", "Text": "The BBC reports that Sergei and Yulia Skripal were under Russian surveillance in the months leading up to the nerve agent attack.", "Articles": ["12", "18"]}]}}}
