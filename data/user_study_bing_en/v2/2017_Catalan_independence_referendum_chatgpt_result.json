The referendum sparked growing concerns in Europe (9) and led to the suspension of a referendum law by the Spanish Constitutional Court (10). The law was based on the right to self-determination (3) and was seen as a new legal order in Catalonia (2). The issue of Catalan independence has a long historical background (2,6). The referendum has also caused economic consequences, with businesses moving out of the region (4)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/September/7", "Text": "The Spanish Constitutional Court suspends the Catalan referendum law, causing uncertainty about the planned vote on independence.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/9", "Text": "The law on the referendum on self-determination of Catalonia is published, setting the date for the vote on October 1.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/21", "Text": "The operation Anubis, directed by Judge Juan Antonio Ram\u00edrez, aims to dismantle the organization of the Catalan independence referendum.", "Articles": ["1", "8"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/1", "Text": "The Catalan self-determination referendum, in which 90% of voters support independence, takes place despite being declared illegal by the Spanish government.", "Articles": ["2", "5"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/29", "Text": "Spain accuses Russia of interference in the Catalan independence crisis.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/30", "Text": "Since the Catalan independence referendum, over 2,700 businesses have moved out of Catalonia.", "Articles": ["4"]}]}, "2017 Catalan Independence Referendum": {"upper_aspect": "other", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Consulta aqu\u00ed los resultados del refer\u00e9ndum en Catalunya", "\u2018I\u2019ve never felt Spanish\u2019: pro-independence Catalans explain why they ...", "Catalan independence referendum sparks growing concerns in Europe", "Catalonia referendum: What just happened? | CNN", "Spanish PM Rajoy boasts of confiscating 100,000 posters f...", "Catalonia referendum: Tense independence vote looms | CNN", "Catalonia referendum: Protestors to be investigated for inciting ...", "Catalonia independence referendum: Just 9 new countries were founded in ...", "Catalonia referendum: Outcry as Spanish high court orders Google to ...", "The Catalan referendum tears through Spain - The Independent", "Catalonia referendum: Thousands protest in Barcelona against ...", "The myth of massive support for independence in Catalonia", "Lessons For Taiwan From The Catalan And Kurdish Referendums?", "Catalonia referendum: What just happened? | CNN", "How FC Barcelona became the beating heart of the battle for Catalan ...", "Catalans defy Madrid with vote for independence | Financial Times", "Tearful Gerard Pique offers to quit Spain duty if his support for ...", "Catalonia referendum: How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote", "Preliminary data from... - Maslen Aviation Consultancy - Facebook", "Catalonia Independence - ESO\u2019s Position - LinkedIn"], "1": {"Title": "Consulta aqu\u00ed los resultados del refer\u00e9ndum en Catalunya", "Snippet": "26/10/2017 10:18:57 Resultados del refer\u00e9ndum en Catalunya Consulta aqu\u00ed todos los resultados del refer\u00e9ndum sobre la independencia de Catalunya en Catalunya .", "URL": "https://www.lavanguardia.com/referendum/index.html", "Date": "2017-10-26"}, "2": {"Title": "\u2018I\u2019ve never felt Spanish\u2019: pro-independence Catalans explain why they ...", "Snippet": "The country has been in constitutional turmoil since Catalans backed independence in an October 1 referendum that was dismissed as illegal by Spain.", "URL": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2117583/ive-never-felt-spanish-pro-independence-catalans-explain-why-they", "Date": "2024-08-02"}, "3": {"Title": "Catalan independence referendum sparks growing concerns in Europe", "Snippet": "11 August 2017.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy invoked Article 155 of the constitution to dissolve the regional government of Catalonia and take control (1,7,9). The referendum was seen as a push for independence, with the Catalan government promising it would be binding (8,9).

Despite efforts by the Spanish government to prevent the referendum from taking place, the Catalan government remained determined to hold it (2). The referendum sparked a political crisis and resulted in the relocation of thousands of businesses from Catalonia (4). The issue of Catalan independence also raised concerns about the potential economic impact (5). The Canadian government expressed support for Spain's actions to prevent the referendum (6).

The referendum was met with protests from both sides, with thousands of Spaniards taking to the streets in opposition (3). After the polls closed, Puigdemont declared that Catalonia had won the right to become an independent state (9). However, the declaration of independence was suspended by the Catalan parliament (7) and ultimately declared self-defeating (8). The Spanish navy even sent ships to Barcelona during the crisis (6). Despite the controversy, the results of the referendum were published and can be accessed (1)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/September/14", "Text": "Catalan separatists officially launch their campaign for the banned independence referendum.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/29", "Text": "Catalonia's president Carles Puigdemont calls for the referendum to be held, setting the stage for the upcoming vote.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/1", "Text": "The highly disputed independence referendum takes place, despite being declared illegal by Spanish authorities.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/7", "Text": "Thousands of Spaniards take to the streets in protest of the independence referendum.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/10", "Text": "The Spanish navy sends three ships to Barcelona as tensions rise.", "Articles": ["6", "7"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/17", "Text": "The Spanish court officially declares the Catalan independence referendum illegal.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/26", "Text": "Results of the referendum are announced, showing a majority in favor of independence.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/27", "Text": "The Catalan parliament votes in favor of declaring independence from Spain.", "Articles": ["8"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/27", "Text": "Catalan president Carles Puigdemont declares that Catalonia has won the right to become an independent state.", "Articles": ["9"]}]}, "Generalitat Of Catalonia": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["\u00bfQu\u00e9 es el refer\u00e9ndum de Catalu\u00f1a del 2017?

The Catalan government defended their right to independence (5, 11) and received support from Nobel Peace Prize winners (18). The referendum was scheduled for October 1, 2017 (6, 7, 9) but was ultimately blocked by the Spanish government (15). The economic impact of the potential secession from Spain was also a major concern (20)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/October/1", "Text": "The Catalan self-determination referendum is held, sparking a crisis between Catalonia and Spain.", "Articles": ["6", "7", "12", "13"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/2", "Text": "Catalan President Carles Puigdemont declares that the \"yes\" side has won the referendum, with 90% of the vote.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/4", "Text": "The Spanish king urges authorities to defend the \"constitutional order\" in response to the Catalan independence bid.", "Articles": ["1"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/12", "Text": "The Catalan self-determination referendum results are officially announced, showing a \"yes\" side victory.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/16", "Text": "Catalan President Carles Puigdemont defends the region's claim to independence as Spain prepares to suspend self-rule.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/17", "Text": "The Spanish court officially rules the Catalan independence referendum illegal.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/26", "Text": "The results of the Catalan self-determination referendum are published.", "Articles": ["12"]}, {"Date": "2017/October/27", "Text": "Mariano Rajoy fires the Catalan regional government and dissolves parliament in response to the independence declaration.", "Articles": ["10"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/4", "Text": "Spain accuses Russia of interfering in the Catalan crisis.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2017/November/6", "Text": "Deposed Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont hands himself in to Belgian police.", "Articles": ["8"]}]}}}
