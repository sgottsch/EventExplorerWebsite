The tower was part of the Lancaster West estate which was built between 1972 and 1981 (1). The area had a turbulent history and was infamous for its poverty and wealth disparities (1,3). The fire burned for 60 hours and resulted in the death of 72 people (2). The tragedy prompted a wider debate on the standard of social housing blocks in the country (3). A BBC investigation concluded that the dramatic story of a baby being thrown from a window during the fire was most likely false (9). The fire also shed light on the issue of cost taking precedence over safety in building regulations (10)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/June/14", "Text": "The Grenfell Tower fire, a 24-storey high-rise, breaks out in North Kensington, West London.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/16", "Text": "The Grenfell Tower fire prompts a wider debate on the standard of social housing blocks across the country.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/18", "Text": "The Observer reports on the Grenfell Tower fire and its devastating impact.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/21", "Text": "Nigerian writer Ben Okri writes a poem about the Grenfell Tower fire to raise funds for relatives of victims and survivors.", "Articles": ["7"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/24", "Text": "The London police blame flammable materials used in the Grenfell Tower's recent renovation for the deadly fire.", "Articles": ["10"]}]}, "London Fire Brigade": {"upper_aspect": "who", "Document_Ranking": {"Documents_List": ["Grenfell Tower fire: Heroes awards for three dogs who helped ...", "Grenfell Tower fire - Wikipedia", "How the Grenfell Tower disaster unfolded | Grenfell Tower fire | The ...", "London fire: Six killed as Grenfell Tower engulfed - BBC", "Grenfell Tower fire: Full details of all the missing people", "London residents warned of fire safety scams after Grenfell Tower ...", "Grenfell Tower: Firefighters who battled blaze were 'prepared to die ...", "Grenfell Tower: What happened - BBC News", "What we know and what we do not know about the Grenfell Tower fire", "Fire in London high-rise leaves at least 12 dead in Grenfell Tower ...", "Grenfell Tower: London Fire Brigade update | Sadiq Khan, fire ...", "London fire: Twelve dead in Grenfell Tower blaze - BBC", "Emergency services speak from scene of Grenfell Tower fire", "London Fire: Photos From the Scene of Grenfell Tower | TIME", "Grenfell Tower fire was 'entirely predictable' and could have been ...", "Grenfell Tower fire: Death toll set to rise as desperate search for ...", "London fire: 'Chimney effect could be reason Grenfell Tower blaze ...", "London Fire Brigade Praised For Courage Following Grenfell Tower Blaze ...", "'Amazing' emergency services work through night at Grenfell Tower fire", "Grenfell Tower fire victim's last phone call to brother: 'Why did you ..."], "1": {"Title": "Grenfell Tower fire: Heroes awards for three dogs who helped ...", "Snippet": "Three dogs from the London Fire Brigade who helped investigators at the Grenfell Tower fire have been honoured with a Animal Heroes Award..

It was the deadliest structural fire in the UK since 1988 (1). The fire was caused by a faulty refrigerator (4). The building was part of a regeneration scheme for the estate (19). Seventy people died at the scene and two died later in the hospital, with over 70 injured and 223 escaping (1). The fire exposed the hidden human tragedy of poverty and gentrification in London (3,11,18). The fire spread rapidly due to the building's flammable cladding (12). The London Fire Brigade and other emergency services responded to the fire (7,13,15). Volunteers from all over London and beyond joined in the relief effort (17). A comprehensive guide to the Grenfell Tower cladding was published on Reddit (5). A legal battle for justice for the victims of the fire continues (11). The legacy of the Grenfell Tower fire has had a significant impact on the insurance sector (16)."}, "Timeline": [{"Date": "2017/June/14", "Text": "The Grenfell Tower fire breaks out, killing 70 people at the scene and injuring over 70 others.", "Articles": ["1", "7", "9", "15", "20"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/15", "Text": "Theresa May visits the scene of the Grenfell Tower fire and speaks to members of the London Fire Brigade.", "Articles": ["2"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/18", "Text": "A comprehensive guide to the Grenfell Tower cladding is published on Reddit.", "Articles": ["5"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/22", "Text": "The new Labour MP for Kensington makes a speech criticizing poverty in the area following the Grenfell Tower disaster.", "Articles": ["18"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/24", "Text": "A resident of Grenfell Tower recounts escaping the fire and the terrifying moments leading up to it.", "Articles": ["4"]}, {"Date": "2017/June/26", "Text": "Experts discuss the economic system that contributed to the Grenfell Tower tragedy.", "Articles": ["3"]}, {"Date": "2017/July/21", "Text": "The history of the Grenfell Tower and the surrounding area, including a turbulent past and a recent regeneration scheme, is explored.", "Articles": ["6"]}, {"Date": "2017/July/24", "Text": "Lawyers at North Kensington Law Centre reflect on the parallels between the Grenfell Tower disaster and the shanty town that previously existed in the area.", "Articles": ["11"]}, {"Date": "2017/August/1", "Text": "The insurance sector discusses the impact of the Grenfell Tower fire and its aftermath.", "Articles": ["16"]}, {"Date": "2017/August/17", "Text": "Two months after the Grenfell Tower fire, the building remains a blackened shell and the tragedy continues to impact the community.", "Articles": ["14"]}, {"Date": "2017/September/8", "Text": "Three dogs from the London Fire Brigade who helped with the investigation of the Grenfell Tower fire receive Animal Heroes Awards.", "Articles": ["8"]}]}}}
